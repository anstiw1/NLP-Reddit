"Why has the topic of Elon Musk dropped off this sub, especially in light of what is going on?",39,"It is kind of strange, several years ago, the Elon Musk hype train was in hyper drive, millions of upvotes. He still is the Howard Hughes of the 21st (religious) Century. But, he also seems to be following Howard Hughes in the mental stability area.

So, now, he is part of the Resurrection Re-Opening Street Mob, emo-feelies over-riding science.  
  
This is part of the Real Future, and it is blindingly naive and delusional to 'believe' there may not be another pandemic, soon.

So there’s not doubt that the last ~100 years of so have been the most fast paced in our history when it comes to technological and societal changes. That trend definitely continued into the 21st century with the explosion of the internet and the introduction of the smart phone. However, what doesn’t appear as immediately obvious to me is that this trend has continued in the last few years. It seems that every advance we’ve made are either small changes to existing tech (like smartphones) or still more of a concept and not leading to mass adaptation (maybe something along the lines of VR).

The foreseable future in terms of consumer trends?,23,"I am convinced that in the near future scarcity will become a selling point for various media consumption behaviors. 

Economically speaking, scarcity has always played a major role in driving prices up and generating consumer interest towards a product or service, right?

However, since the launch of the Internet and, even more so, since smartphones became mainstream, consumers have grown accustomed to having everything readily available 24/7.

Want to binge watch 20 episodes of 'Seinfeld'? Sure, have at it! Want to watch your favourite Youtuber? Anytime, anywhere! Want to order in food on a Sunday afternoon and not even have to touch your phone? Just ask Siri/Google/Alexa!

The end result of this is, obviously, raising the bar for what a service/app should have as basic functionality, a bar set so high that the point of entry on any market that provides these services is not easy to reach for anyone starting out, but only for a select few, that have the resources and manpower to compete.

However, I've started to notice a trend lately, where scarcity is becoming a thing that drives consumer attention in mediums where, traditionally, the selling point was being able to acces the product/service 24/7.

Here's an example: Travis Scott's concerts in Fortnite. (  Scheduled, and available for a limited time. If you wanted to experience them, you had to be there, logged into the game at the exact time they were live. Otherwise you can watch them on Youtube, sure, but that's just from someone else's perspective, it is not your personal experience. These had record numbers of attendance, for instance.

So, basically, my question to you all is this: do you believe that in the coming future offering limited time/access to services (online, mostly) will become a better marketing tactic? Is returning to an age where everything was on a schedule and you had to adapt to that schedule, instead of having everything on-demand all the time, the answer to driving consumer attention and retention? 

TL;DR - Scarcity in availability for certain online services, events etc. has shown to be a real driver behind consumer retention and attention lately. Do you think this will increase in the near future or is it just an accident?",Futurology,the foreseable future in terms of consumer trends i am convinced that in the near future scarcity will become a selling point for various media consumption behaviors economically speaking scarcity has always played a major role in driving prices up and generating consumer interest towards a product or service right however since the launch of the internet and even more so since smartphones became mainstream consumers have grown accustomed to having everything readily available  want to binge watch episodes of seinfeld sure have at it want to watch your favourite youtuber anytime anywhere want to order in food on a sunday afternoon and not even have to touch your phone just ask siri google alexa the end result of this is obviously raising the bar for what a service app should have as basic functionality a bar set so high that the point of entry on any market that provides these services is not easy to reach for anyone starting out but only for a select few that have the resources and manpower to compete however ive started to notice a trend lately where scarcity is becoming a thing that drives consumer attention in mediums where traditionally the selling point was being able to acces the product service  heres an example travis scotts concerts in fortnite scheduled and available for a limited time if you wanted to experience them you had to be there logged into the game at the exact time they were live otherwise you can watch them on youtube sure but thats just from someone elses perspective it is not your personal experience these had record numbers of attendance for instance so basically my question to you all is this do you believe that in the coming future offering limited time access to services online mostly will become a better marketing tactic is returning to an age where everything was on a schedule and you had to adapt to that schedule instead of having everything on demand all the time the answer to driving consumer attention and retention tl dr scarcity in availability for certain online services events etc has shown to be a real driver behind consumer retention and attention lately do you think this will increase in the near future or is it just an accident

"The brain does it, computers don't, isn't this what we're missing for an artificial consciousness?",3,"Mindfulness practice has become really big in recent years.

I think anyone can recognise the experience of walking along minding your own business, no real outside indication that anything much is going on.

The hidden life within, however, could not be more different, inundated with an unending slew of seemingly random thoughts and drudgery of distant memory.

That rise in mindfulness popularity tells me I'm not the only one that can find this process, in the least quite annoying and accentuated a little further can be pretty negative.

Aside from the way we feel about this process, it's pretty clear computers don't do this - and I'm wondering whether, in order to make progress, we may need them to.

Now I don't know definitively that this process of surfacing ideas is random, but it feels sufficiently so for me to use 'random' as the assumption.

&amp;#x200B;

I order for an AI to make progress and develop itself maybe we need it to have an idle loop of constant thought generation? It's certainly a hallmark of consciousness, but could well be a process for it to develop itself in general?

Without getting too into what an 'experience' is, couldn't we get an AI to somewhat chaotically search its memory for pieces of data (something it has 'learned' or 'experienced') bring it into the current context (which may be different from the original) and attempt to combine to see if anything useful can come from it.

Context aside, that same process for two disparate chunks of data - compare them, see if inferences could be drawn etc. effectively generating new output without necessitating new input.

I'd stipulate a process like this would be essential for a digital consciousness, but that it could also be useful for the learning and development of an AI generally, to always be cycling through the data it has, comparing, combining, recombining?

I'd call it something like an active internal learning process - significantly differentiated from learning through the feeding in a new dataset.",Futurology,the brain does it computers dont isnt this what were missing for an artificial consciousness mindfulness practice has become really big in recent years i think anyone can recognise the experience of walking along minding your own business no real outside indication that anything much is going on the hidden life within however could not be more different inundated with an unending slew of seemingly random thoughts and drudgery of distant memory that rise in mindfulness popularity tells me im not the only one that can find this process in the least quite annoying and accentuated a little further can be pretty negative aside from the way we feel about this process its pretty clear computers dont do this and im wondering whether in order to make progress we may need them to now i dont know definitively that this process of surfacing ideas is random but it feels sufficiently so for me to use random as the assumption amp x b i order for an ai to make progress and develop itself maybe we need it to have an idle loop of constant thought generation its certainly a hallmark of consciousness but could well be a process for it to develop itself in general without getting too into what an experience is couldnt we get an ai to somewhat chaotically search its memory for pieces of data something it has learned or experienced bring it into the current context which may be different from the original and attempt to combine to see if anything useful can come from it context aside that same process for two disparate chunks of data compare them see if inferences could be drawn etc effectively generating new output without necessitating new input id stipulate a process like this would be essential for a digital consciousness but that it could also be useful for the learning and development of an ai generally to always be cycling through the data it has comparing combining recombining id call it something like an active internal learning process significantly differentiated from learning through the feeding in a new dataset

A question on if a superintelligence could last forever,29,"&amp;#x200B;

Eternal superintelligence (wow, how cliche)

(posted from [r/askPhilosophy](  

So, I’ve had this question that’s been bugging me recently, and wanted to know the answer. Basically, you have a completely fair, random game. You have a 1/100 chance of winning on the first round. However, the next round, your odds drop to 1/200, then 1/400, then 1/800, etc. Essentially, after a few more games, your odds would be incredibly skewed against you. However, if we repeated this game an infinite amount of times, would you still win eventually? Mathematically, no, as geometric sequences have a finite (non 100%) answer, but probability works a lot different, but is also tied with math fundamentally. Logically, you would be able to win, even after 50 games and your odds are almost none, for in an infinite amount of time, every possible outcome should happen, but mathematically, you essentially have a 100% chance of losing (This still means that the formula is applied to each of the infinite games). Any thoughts? Thanks for any answers.

**PLEASE READ** Side note: this is meant to simulate the exponential growth of intelligence in superintelligence, and the “random chance” are the slight (and compoundingly shrinking) errors that may end up changing the ai’s end goal. The reason for this question is mainly for if an ai were to be benevolent, and if that benevolence (or malevolence) could theoretically last forever. Though, I won’t underestimate the sheer precision it would take in order to create an ai like that, but again, this is just a thought experiment. I’m assuming that the geometric formula also applies to mass, (as in the ai learns to become exponentially more efficient with mass and energy) and the conservation of mass, too.

Thanks!",Futurology,a question on if a superintelligence could last forever amp x b eternal superintelligence wow how cliche posted from r askphilosophy so ive had this question thats been bugging me recently and wanted to know the answer basically you have a completely fair random game you have a  chance of winning on the first round however the next round your odds drop to  then  then  etc essentially after a few more games your odds would be incredibly skewed against you however if we repeated this game an infinite amount of times would you still win eventually mathematically no as geometric sequences have a finite non  answer but probability works a lot different but is also tied with math fundamentally logically you would be able to win even after games and your odds are almost none for in an infinite amount of time every possible outcome should happen but mathematically you essentially have a chance of losing this still means that the formula is applied to each of the infinite games any thoughts thanks for any answers please read side note this is meant to simulate the exponential growth of intelligence in superintelligence and the random chance are the slight and compoundingly shrinking errors that may end up changing the ais end goal the reason for this question is mainly for if an ai were to be benevolent and if that benevolence or malevolence could theoretically last forever though i wont underestimate the sheer precision it would take in order to create an ai like that but again this is just a thought experiment im assuming that the geometric formula also applies to mass as in the ai learns to become exponentially more efficient with mass and energy and the conservation of mass too thanks

Medically-achieved biological immortality is gonna have serious and terrifying implications on the entire world.,5,"Before I get downvoted to oblivion, I just wanna put it out there that this is the product of my poorly assembled thoughts over what would happen if we as a species achieve biological immortality through medical technology. I was thinking it through and just want a place to discuss this idea.

I know the ""cure for ageing"" has always been ""20 years away"", like fusion in a really loose way, but just think about what happens when it finally arrives.

Obviously, the devil is in the details. What if it's customised, like some sort of genetic restoration therapy? Can only the rich afford these magic youth treatments? Will they maintain a 30-year old body as long as the treatments last? Will some parts of the body be unrepairable, like the brain? But for brevity in this short-ish writeup I'm going to assume the best case (regular, occasional treatments restore your body biologically to about 30-years old), with the caveat that only the rich can afford such treatment.

What would happen if the rich didn't die? There is a saying that wealth does not pass three generations. Many reasons abound for this, but my go-to explanation is that the rich man's descendants inherit money they did not earn, and not the prudence or drive that generated that wealth, leading them to squander the money. With immortality, they won't be inheriting anything because the rich guy won't wanna be doing any dying if he could help it. Cue the Games of Thrones by potentially dissatisfied descendants who want more, which is a terrifying possible implication on the world.

Another thing that applies to the greater world is that the world will become more stagnant. Most of us would be familiar with the idea of fresh faces bringing fresh ideas and political reform. With immortality, that will slow and eventually stop. What would happen if the government was dominated by a few talking heads spouting the same bunch of worldviews for eternity? Without death as a factor causing those at the top to change, would violence be the alternative, or some sort of socially agreed-upon system to evolve the scene (like democracy)? You may consider today's US political system as most closely modelling a system equipped to handle the implications of medically-achieved biological immortality (2 terms and you're done, keeps the office full of fresh faces and ideas), but the US has its own problems with corporate hegemony and whatnot, which pushes the issues to that sphere instead. In fact, I think we're seeing some of the issues of immortality embodied in the corporate America system already.

Now again, before you crucify me for my sweeping generalizations and dramatization, I don't fully buy these arguments either. I doubt the world would burn down upon finding the fountain of youth. They're ideas which I had a little shower thought over, and now I'm hoping that I'm wrong about at least some of these things.",Futurology,medically achieved biological immortality is gonna have serious and terrifying implications on the entire world before i get downvoted to oblivion i just wanna put it out there that this is the product of my poorly assembled thoughts over what would happen if we as a species achieve biological immortality through medical technology i was thinking it through and just want a place to discuss this idea i know the cure for ageing has always been years away like fusion in a really loose way but just think about what happens when it finally arrives obviously the devil is in the details what if its customised like some sort of genetic restoration therapy can only the rich afford these magic youth treatments will they maintain a year old body as long as the treatments last will some parts of the body be unrepairable like the brain but for brevity in this short ish writeup im going to assume the best case regular occasional treatments restore your body biologically to about years old with the caveat that only the rich can afford such treatment what would happen if the rich didnt die there is a saying that wealth does not pass three generations many reasons abound for this but my go to explanation is that the rich mans descendants inherit money they did not earn and not the prudence or drive that generated that wealth leading them to squander the money with immortality they wont be inheriting anything because the rich guy wont wanna be doing any dying if he could help it cue the games of thrones by potentially dissatisfied descendants who want more which is a terrifying possible implication on the world another thing that applies to the greater world is that the world will become more stagnant most of us would be familiar with the idea of fresh faces bringing fresh ideas and political reform with immortality that will slow and eventually stop what would happen if the government was dominated by a few talking heads spouting the same bunch of worldviews for eternity without death as a factor causing those at the top to change would violence be the alternative or some sort of socially agreed upon system to evolve the scene like democracy you may consider todays us political system as most closely modelling a system equipped to handle the implications of medically achieved biological immortality terms and youre done keeps the office full of fresh faces and ideas but the us has its own problems with corporate hegemony and whatnot which pushes the issues to that sphere instead in fact i think were seeing some of the issues of immortality embodied in the corporate america system already now again before you crucify me for my sweeping generalizations and dramatization i dont fully buy these arguments either i doubt the world would burn down upon finding the fountain of youth theyre ideas which i had a little shower thought over and now im hoping that im wrong about at least some of these things

"Stop Trying to Make Nuclear Power Happen, It's not Going to Happen",37,"&gt;One problem, says the AEC, is that we were building on kind of reactor when we should have started with a different type. So far, all the power reactors are ""burner-converters."" They consume fuel.The reactor we should have started with is the ""breeder,"" which produces-from non fissionable material, including ordinary granitic rock-more fuel than it consumes. Fuel supplies for burner-converters would last only about as long as our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels.

These words could've been written yesterday by any nuclear power advocate. But they were written in *Popular Mechanics* in [June 1963](  As it turns out, we've been making excuses for nuclear power for many years.

But the simple problem with nuclear power is cost not any irrational fears among the public. That can be seen in the [trends of nuclear reactor construction](  which was declining before 3 mile island and kept declining steadily afterwards. Nuclear power plants have proven to be huge money pits with massive cost overruns.

If the only thing keeping us from a nuclear powered utopia was irrational public safety concerns, then why don't we see them popping up like mushrooms in places like China that don't care about that sort of thing? In fact, China gets just 6% of its power from nuclear. The ""hysterical"" United States gets 20%. The simple answer is its too costly.

And the promise of better reactors always turns out to not pan out in real life. We've tried them all, fast breeder reactors, thorium reactors, pebble bed reactors, and they've all proved underwhelming. 

The future of energy is solar. Unlike nuclear, it has gotten cheaper, not dearer, over time. And by putting solar power stations in space, where they'll be in the sun's path 24/7, and beaming the power down to earth, we eliminate the problem of intermittancy. So it's time to put to rest our fantasies about the mighty power of the atom.",Futurology,stop trying to make nuclear power happen its not going to happen gt one problem says the aec is that we were building on kind of reactor when we should have started with a different type so far all the power reactors are burner converters they consume fuel the reactor we should have started with is the breeder which produces from non fissionable material including ordinary granitic rock more fuel than it consumes fuel supplies for burner converters would last only about as long as our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels these words couldve been written yesterday by any nuclear power advocate but they were written in popular mechanics in june  as it turns out weve been making excuses for nuclear power for many years but the simple problem with nuclear power is cost not any irrational fears among the public that can be seen in the trends of nuclear reactor construction which was declining before mile island and kept declining steadily afterwards nuclear power plants have proven to be huge money pits with massive cost overruns if the only thing keeping us from a nuclear powered utopia was irrational public safety concerns then why dont we see them popping up like mushrooms in places like china that dont care about that sort of thing in fact china gets just of its power from nuclear the hysterical united states gets the simple answer is its too costly and the promise of better reactors always turns out to not pan out in real life weve tried them all fast breeder reactors thorium reactors pebble bed reactors and theyve all proved underwhelming the future of energy is solar unlike nuclear it has gotten cheaper not dearer over time and by putting solar power stations in space where theyll be in the suns path  and beaming the power down to earth we eliminate the problem of intermittancy so its time to put to rest our fantasies about the mighty power of the atom

This one was inspired by a dream my daughter had.,2,"So I'm kind of an insomniac who also happens to have 2 kids. It's kind of nice because I can be there right away if they have a bad dream because I can hear my eldest daughter from the living room. So I heard her yell for mom, and rushed to her side. She said she had a bad dream, and it was about spiders making shoes for her. I immediatly realized that she was probably having that dream because we got a 3d printer finally, and after much finagling with it we got it to print 3 things with the Ender 5. I had her watch and described exactly how it was making the plastic cat, and I ended it by telling her it was our own robot. Y'all should have seen the light in her eyes.


So that got me to thinking about 3d printers and how you could use a spider type chassis, or hell even actual living spiders that you take neural control over which are genetically engineered to make the filimant you want. I mean they have taken remote control over a cockroach so why not a spider. Couldn't we systematically feed and raise them, and then implant them when the time is right? Ok so maybe lets not go to nightmare town tonight. What if we simply utilized the spiders 8 legged design to create a portable 3d printer that can adapt to the environment. Perhaps this robot could even eat of a sort. In that they could use bacteria and other natural organisms to break down plant matter so that it can produce more filimant internally. Perhaps it could also generate energy by eating things from the environment. Just to be clear you wouldn't fully automate this. I believe in a broadcast architecture in terms of A.I. safety. That way you only have one point of failure that you have to look at. Let the robots themselves be dumb as bricks as far as I am concerned.",Futurology,this one was inspired by a dream my daughter had so im kind of an insomniac who also happens to have kids its kind of nice because i can be there right away if they have a bad dream because i can hear my eldest daughter from the living room so i heard her yell for mom and rushed to her side she said she had a bad dream and it was about spiders making shoes for her i immediatly realized that she was probably having that dream because we got a d printer finally and after much finagling with it we got it to print things with the ender i had her watch and described exactly how it was making the plastic cat and i ended it by telling her it was our own robot yall should have seen the light in her eyes so that got me to thinking about d printers and how you could use a spider type chassis or hell even actual living spiders that you take neural control over which are genetically engineered to make the filimant you want i mean they have taken remote control over a cockroach so why not a spider couldnt we systematically feed and raise them and then implant them when the time is right ok so maybe lets not go to nightmare town tonight what if we simply utilized the spiders legged design to create a portable d printer that can adapt to the environment perhaps this robot could even eat of a sort in that they could use bacteria and other natural organisms to break down plant matter so that it can produce more filimant internally perhaps it could also generate energy by eating things from the environment just to be clear you wouldnt fully automate this i believe in a broadcast architecture in terms of a i safety that way you only have one point of failure that you have to look at let the robots themselves be dumb as bricks as far as i am concerned

Possible solution to AGI alignment and safety?,8,"Problem:

We will probably create AGI before we have a formal model of human ethics, which is not an urgent problem but a potentially catastrophic one.

Proposed solution:

We assume we want that AGI (Artificial general intelligence) to be aligned with all life and we want it to produce maximum ""good"". We then define ""good"" as whatever any unit of life defines as such. (Interactions between units will produce additional emergent definitions.) Then instead of optimizing for any of those definitions we set AGI's utility function as maximization of the definitions, that is: maximization of the quantity of both units of life and interactions between units, and then to make it all safe we forbid it from interacting with either. Maximizing the quantity of life without interacting with it means both shielding life from cataclysmic events and creating space for life's expansion into places where no life exists (outer space).

More details: pni.ai/future

My intuition is that this can be expressed formally, simulated and proven/disproven and if proven may lead to a future with potential for growth that are hard to imagine, yet without any risk to life and without making humans obsolete. There is also no benefit in being the first to create such AGI and all the reasons to cooperate as it produces universal ""good"".

The problem is that while water evaporates all the things that were in that water don't, so salt and pollution builds up. This makes them almost lifeless. We see this in places like the Salton Sea in California, the Great Salt Lake in Utah, and the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan. Only the hardiest forms of life can survive in these bodies of water and they create a nasty odor. In 2012, a die off of fish on the shores of the Salton led to a raw egg smell that could be smelled all the way in Los Angeles, 150 miles away.

The Solar Power Epoch,27,"Solar Power is [getting cheaper at a faster pace](  than almost anyone predicted, now costing less than 5 cents per kwh. And we're still not done with the cost reductions.

\-Solar cells are currently made from polysilicon, which is difficult to manufacture. [Perovskite](  promises lower costs

\-Solar cell efficiency is currently about 20%. Hot carrier cells could raise this to [over 80%]( 

\-Solar power satellites, by almost always being in the sun's path and receiving more intense sunlight, could get 7 times as much power as [solar panels on the ground.]( 

With that, we can now dream of an era where power is, well, too cheap to meter. Many great new things will become possible:

\-Metallurgy will be transformed. The reason why steel hasn't been surpassed by superior alternatives such as aluminum, titanium, or magnesium is because the others use so much energy in their production. 

\-Chemical production will also be transformed. Carbon fiber is also held back by its high energy costs despite being stronger than steel and far lighter. Just like aluminum, titanium, and magnesium, carbon fiber offers a promising alternative to steel. The reason why we still farm our food rather than produce it in a factory is the amount of energy required. After 10,000 years, agriculture will be obsolete.

\-We'll have all the water we could possibly need, not just through desalination but through the low cost reverse osmosis of sewage. We probably won't get the chance to turn the world's deserts into farmland thanks to synthetic food, but the lifeless Salton Sea, Dead Sea, and Great Salt Lake could be made fresh.

\-The use of heat can be substituted for brute force in many applications. Digging underground could be done by melting or vaporizing the rock in front for the construction of highways, railroads, storage tanks, and for mining. We could even burrow to the earth's mantle, which would offer great scientific knowledge.

\-Recycling becomes much less expensive since melting down waste materials uses a lot of energy. This will be of great benefit to the environment. 

\-If we use lithium air batteries, we can bring this revolution of low cost power to transportation. Your car could travel on jets of compressed air and Hypersonic or VTOL aircraft become affordable.",Futurology,the solar power epoch solar power is getting cheaper at a faster pace than almost anyone predicted now costing less than cents per kwh and were still not done with the cost reductions solar cells are currently made from polysilicon which is difficult to manufacture perovskite promises lower costs solar cell efficiency is currently about hot carrier cells could raise this to over  solar power satellites by almost always being in the suns path and receiving more intense sunlight could get times as much power as solar panels on the ground with that we can now dream of an era where power is well too cheap to meter many great new things will become possible metallurgy will be transformed the reason why steel hasnt been surpassed by superior alternatives such as aluminum titanium or magnesium is because the others use so much energy in their production chemical production will also be transformed carbon fiber is also held back by its high energy costs despite being stronger than steel and far lighter just like aluminum titanium and magnesium carbon fiber offers a promising alternative to steel the reason why we still farm our food rather than produce it in a factory is the amount of energy required after  years agriculture will be obsolete well have all the water we could possibly need not just through desalination but through the low cost reverse osmosis of sewage we probably wont get the chance to turn the worlds deserts into farmland thanks to synthetic food but the lifeless salton sea dead sea and great salt lake could be made fresh the use of heat can be substituted for brute force in many applications digging underground could be done by melting or vaporizing the rock in front for the construction of highways railroads storage tanks and for mining we could even burrow to the earths mantle which would offer great scientific knowledge recycling becomes much less expensive since melting down waste materials uses a lot of energy this will be of great benefit to the environment if we use lithium air batteries we can bring this revolution of low cost power to transportation your car could travel on jets of compressed air and hypersonic or vtol aircraft become affordable

Evolution of humans on terraformed Mars and other planets?,8,"With the likelihood of human colonisation of Mars becoming increasingly likely, and the eventual colonisation of the rest of the solar system along with it, it's interesting to think how in many thousands of years, after terraforming has occurred, the descendants of the colonists may have evolved and branched off of Homo Sapiens.

For Mars I can think of a few possibilities such as:

-the lower levels of natural sunlight may lead to Humanoids shedding all hair on their bodies (including head hair) in order to absorb more sunlight. I would guess eyebrows at least would remain.

-the lower gravity may lead to them becoming less muscular and having a more slender build, especially the males

Guaranteed Basic Income,9,"Much has been said of late concerning UBI. I'd propose a guaranteed basic income instead in which the government supplements the incomes of those living under the poverty line in a given jurisdiction.

In my case in Canada the poverty line for a family of two adults and two children is around $40,000 per year (but it varies province to province). For an individual living alone it ranges from $20,000 to $25,000. So anyone in those circumstances making less than those amounts would get a monthly supplemental payment to bring them to the desired income level. Those unemployed would get the full amount taking them above that poverty line number.

We can discuss a lot of pros and cons but we should factor in that it would effectively replace programs like welfare, unemployment insurance and (in the case of Canada) the child tax benefit, food stamps (for the US) and most other social programs. So the costs overall would not just be the amount needed to run such a program but the cost factoring in the elimination of those programs.",Futurology,guaranteed basic income much has been said of late concerning ubi id propose a guaranteed basic income instead in which the government supplements the incomes of those living under the poverty line in a given jurisdiction in my case in canada the poverty line for a family of two adults and two children is around  per year but it varies province to province for an individual living alone it ranges from  to  so anyone in those circumstances making less than those amounts would get a monthly supplemental payment to bring them to the desired income level those unemployed would get the full amount taking them above that poverty line number we can discuss a lot of pros and cons but we should factor in that it would effectively replace programs like welfare unemployment insurance and in the case of canada the child tax benefit food stamps for the us and most other social programs so the costs overall would not just be the amount needed to run such a program but the cost factoring in the elimination of those programs

Right now my 1st draft for the habitat area is for an outer radius of 3.5km, and length of 100km; with people stacked an average of 5 storeys deep/high at 170m2 living area per person, that gives me room for 64.5 million. (1 storey will support 12.9 million.)

My question is, is this too inefficient? Is there a more efficient way to make use of an asteroid? Assume for theoretical purposes, it's a sphere of about 120km3.",Futurology,help me build a huge space colony hi there im trying to build a high tech future space colony for various fiction uses would be interested in discussing the dimensions and what might go inside it the space colony is inside a hollowed out asteroid im thinking basic space cylinder so shielding isnt a problem i want an apparent gravity of g for at least million people right now my st draft for the habitat area is for an outer radius of km and length of km with people stacked an average of storeys deep high at m living area per person that gives me room for million storey will support million my question is is this too inefficient is there a more efficient way to make use of an asteroid assume for theoretical purposes its a sphere of about km

Is there any AI model that mixes different types of data to build meaning behind any encoding or representation of trained data?,2,"Language to humans means nothing if we don't know the meaning behind the words, children learn by experiencing objects sounds, touch, and taste.

I would assume that we'd need to train AI models to mix different types of data that builds an internal representation of objects, as we do as humans.

One of the challenges behind NLP is to make models understand the meaning behind words in a sentence, but the meaning in languages is expressed by different dimensions to the data for example when you think of an apple, you see an image in your head with colors maybe if you think harder you remember the taste or the smell.

"Twenty Six Predictions for the Next Eleven Months, and Two Technology Predictions for the Years 2022-2025",18,"**Predictions for the Next Eleven Months (For this, I am re-posting what I wrote in another forum about a month ago without any edits.)**

What follows presumes (and this is important) that a vaccine will not be procured any time soon, and that due to the real world being the way it is the virus will instead continue to grow. These are all things that the world can anticipate in the coming year (eleven months). Some of them are already observable.

1. There will probably be a global recession that will in the USA rival the American Great Depression.
2. Strife will rise within China's borders for mostly personal financial reasons.
3. International distrust of China will increase.
4. Social distancing will continue to be encouraged and in some cases enforced by law enforcement across the world. Social distancing will very much be with us for the foreseeable future.
5. Most megachurches will fold, as will many medium-sized ones. Video communing will become a huge part of the Evangelical environment.
6. Many jobs will be move to the home office, and those which require only repetitive physical tasks will be increasingly given to automated machinery.
7. Due to poor sanitation and limited health resources, poorer countries will be decimated.
8. This winter will be cruel and see many deaths as the virus ravishes the poor, the elderly, and those with respiratory illnesses without access to medical assistance.
9. There will be an 8-magnitude earthquake somewhere on the planet. If it effects a heavily populated area unprepared for it, that area will experience a huge spike in deaths by pneumonia.
10. There will be violent civil unrest up to and possibly including isolated pockets of civil battles within the USA. There are too many variables and hot-headed factions for me to confidently guess who will participate.
11. Trump will be reelected, one way or another. And if he is not, those isolated pockets of civil battles will become a civil war incited by the man himself.
12. There will be a significant turn towards home-grown vegetables, and some people will become distrustful of others' home-grown produce and rely on themselves.
13. Faced with spending copious amounts of time with the children they had seldom ever seen, many parents will be unable to emotionally cope with the children and this will lead (and is already leading, mind you) to tons of child abuse.
14. Faced with spending copious amounts of time with the spouses they had not spent quality time with in years, many couples will get divorced.
15. Health care facilities the world over will collapse.
16. Beginning in a few months, those who are altogether elderly, overweight, *and* poor will be hard-pressed to survive.
17. There will be renewed discussion of a universal income in a number of developed countries.
18. Many airlines will fold (as some already are).
19. Tourist towns will either shrink or find another source of income.
20. Theme parks will fold.
21. Many movie theaters will fold.
22. The air will become cleaner (as it already is).
23. There will be a worldwide migration away from physical universities and toward online universities, which will result in earlier marriages as high school sweethearts and finally able to stay together.
24. Due to a worldwide increase in poverty, there will be (and already is) an increasing distaste for wealthy celebrities.
25. Due to a worldwide increase in poverty, there will be an increase in religious devotion (albeit privately expressed devotion, in light of the closure of many places of worship).
26. Among those for whom material wealth had been their sole desire and the source of their ego, there will be an increase in suicides.

**Two Technology Predictions for the Years 2022-2025 (For this, I am re-posting without any edits what I wrote elsewhere a few days ago.)**

**Prediction 1:** Deep fakes, real-time video augmentation, unclothing technology, personalized video backgrounds, and voice isolation, reproduction, and augmentation will come together as an app to allow anyone to produce videos of almost anyone doing and saying anything. It will be available for less than a month.

**Prediction 2:** A higher level of reality augmentation glasses and earbuds.

Within the box will be 1) an ostensibly normal looking glasses with an ear piece on either side and a very tiny microphone; 2) a pair of very small bracelets and anklets; 3) a device no bigger than a pencil sharpener with a clear plastic ball on top and an environment-imaging laser scanner; and 4) some charging chords.

After charging, you turn the scanner on and take it on a tour of your entire place of residence, making sure to scan every nook and cranny, including faucets, light switches, beds, desks, tables, shelves, etc., with drawers, cupboards, and doors in closed and open positions. You will also similarly scan yourself. After this, you will put on the glasses and earpieces, and over the course of a moment teach the microphone to recognize and understand your voice while sad, excited, happy, bored, yelling, whispering, etc. Following this, with a simple pre-programmed voice command, you will see through your glasses and hear through the earpieces a personal companion. He or she will be able to visually and audibly though not tactically interact with both you and do such things as sit on chairs, lie on beds, turn your lights or TV on and off (if you choose, for an extra amount of money, the personal companion will be given control over the electricity in your residence), and hold conversations with you. While wearing the glasses, bracelets, and anklets, you will also be able to, for example, waltz with the ARC (Augmented Reality Companion). By scanning the inside of your vehicle, the ARC will also be able to accompany you on rides and turn the radio to a channel of either your or its own desire.

years   predictions for the next eleven months for this i am re posting what i wrote in another forum about a month ago without any edits what follows presumes and this is important that a vaccine will not be procured any time soon and that due to the real world being the way it is the virus will instead continue to grow these are all things that the world can anticipate in the coming year eleven months some of them are already observable there will probably be a global recession that will in the usa rival the american great depression strife will rise within chinas borders for mostly personal financial reasons international distrust of china will increase social distancing will continue to be encouraged and in some cases enforced by law enforcement across the world social distancing will very much be with us for the foreseeable future most megachurches will fold as will many medium sized ones video communing will become a huge part of the evangelical environment many jobs will be move to the home office and those which require only repetitive physical tasks will be increasingly given to automated machinery due to poor sanitation and limited health resources poorer countries will be decimated this winter will be cruel and see many deaths as the virus ravishes the poor the elderly and those with respiratory illnesses without access to medical assistance there will be an magnitude earthquake somewhere on the planet if it effects a heavily populated area unprepared for it that area will experience a huge spike in deaths by pneumonia there will be violent civil unrest up to and possibly including isolated pockets of civil battles within the usa there are too many variables and hot headed factions for me to confidently guess who will participate trump will be reelected one way or another and if he is not those isolated pockets of civil battles will become a civil war incited by the man himself there will be a significant turn towards home grown vegetables and some people will become distrustful of others home grown produce and rely on themselves faced with spending copious amounts of time with the children they had seldom ever seen many parents will be unable to emotionally cope with the children and this will lead and is already leading mind you to tons of child abuse faced with spending copious amounts of time with the spouses they had not spent quality time with in years many couples will get divorced health care facilities the world over will collapse beginning in a few months those who are altogether elderly overweight and poor will be hard pressed to survive there will be renewed discussion of a universal income in a number of developed countries many airlines will fold as some already are  tourist towns will either shrink or find another source of income theme parks will fold many movie theaters will fold the air will become cleaner as it already is  there will be a worldwide migration away from physical universities and toward online universities which will result in earlier marriages as high school sweethearts and finally able to stay together due to a worldwide increase in poverty there will be and already is an increasing distaste for wealthy celebrities due to a worldwide increase in poverty there will be an increase in religious devotion albeit privately expressed devotion in light of the closure of many places of worship  among those for whom material wealth had been their sole desire and the source of their ego there will be an increase in suicides two technology predictions for the

If applied to the real stock market, the real price is very different from the predicted price.

The Impacts of A Permanent Shift To Remote Work,42,"The remote work revolution, long predicted, oft delayed, seems to be finally happening thanks to COVID-19. Nationwide, PSA, Twitter, and Dell have said they are moving some or all of their workers to remote status permanently. Many others, including the big banks that occupy a disproportionate share of downtown office space, have said they will not need as much space in the future. This is going to be a big deal.

The Italian Physicist [Cesare Marchetti](  found that urban boundaries are defined by the amount of distance that can be covered in a 30 minute commute. As transportation has improved, that distance has increased, leading to more and more urban sprawl. With telecommuting, that distance becomes effectively infinite. So, there will be a bigger move out of dense city centers and into the countryside. Land values will no longer be determined by proximity to employment, but by things like climate and recreational opportunity. 

This change will also mean much of our infrastructure for commuting will be obsolete. Highways will no longer need to be widened to accommodate rush hour traffic. Public transit systems will fall into disuse. And most importantly, tons of office buildings will meet the wrecking ball. 

Demand for child care will drop as parents can now always be at home in case their kids injure themselves. People will travel more as they can work from their hotel rooms and then spend the evening exploring (although time zone differences could be an issue). 

All in all, remote work could lead to bigger changes in our lives than any invention since the Model T.",Futurology,the impacts of a permanent shift to remote work the remote work revolution long predicted oft delayed seems to be finally happening thanks to covid nationwide psa twitter and dell have said they are moving some or all of their workers to remote status permanently many others including the big banks that occupy a disproportionate share of downtown office space have said they will not need as much space in the future this is going to be a big deal the italian physicist cesare marchetti found that urban boundaries are defined by the amount of distance that can be covered in a minute commute as transportation has improved that distance has increased leading to more and more urban sprawl with telecommuting that distance becomes effectively infinite so there will be a bigger move out of dense city centers and into the countryside land values will no longer be determined by proximity to employment but by things like climate and recreational opportunity this change will also mean much of our infrastructure for commuting will be obsolete highways will no longer need to be widened to accommodate rush hour traffic public transit systems will fall into disuse and most importantly tons of office buildings will meet the wrecking ball demand for child care will drop as parents can now always be at home in case their kids injure themselves people will travel more as they can work from their hotel rooms and then spend the evening exploring although time zone differences could be an issue all in all remote work could lead to bigger changes in our lives than any invention since the model t

Generating Animations from Screenplays via Natural Language Processing,8,"I'm surprised I haven't seen any discussions of this very interesting paper by Disney Research, Rutgers University, and ETH Zurich.  They've developed a text-to-animation system that lets you input a screenplay and it outputs a simple animation in the Unreal Engine using a prepared library of assets:

[  

While the intention by the team was not to replace animators or filmmakers (they see it being used to generate simple animatics as a way to help filmmakers and animators plan out their work), clearly to my eyes this is a major step toward a fully automated filmmaking system.  Expand the asset library, include the sorts of animation/physics models already present in videogames, etc. etc. and it's not *that* hard to imagine this fairly simple concept serving as the basis for a full-blown Movie Generator.  It still needs a prepared screenplay, and can only use the assets you provide it, but the potential here is *enormous*.

On the one hand, it's easy to imagine some media giant like Amazon or Netflix using this to churn out fast and cheap animated films.  On the other, can you imagine how much this democratizes movie making?  Imagine elementary school teachers doing lessons on filmmaking, having their students write short scripts and record their dialogue, then running these student films through Text-to-Animation software so they can see their work come to life?  People who today don't have the time or money to do more than write, or unable to get their screenplay more than a glance by people online, can actually get their movies made.  We could see a potential explosion in content, much like how the Internet has already seen an explosion in artwork, music, and writing.",Futurology,generating animations from screenplays via natural language processing im surprised i havent seen any discussions of this very interesting paper by disney research rutgers university and eth zurich theyve developed a text to animation system that lets you input a screenplay and it outputs a simple animation in the unreal engine using a prepared library of assets  while the intention by the team was not to replace animators or filmmakers they see it being used to generate simple animatics as a way to help filmmakers and animators plan out their work clearly to my eyes this is a major step toward a fully automated filmmaking system expand the asset library include the sorts of animation physics models already present in videogames etc etc and its not that hard to imagine this fairly simple concept serving as the basis for a full blown movie generator it still needs a prepared screenplay and can only use the assets you provide it but the potential here is enormous on the one hand its easy to imagine some media giant like amazon or netflix using this to churn out fast and cheap animated films on the other can you imagine how much this democratizes movie making imagine elementary school teachers doing lessons on filmmaking having their students write short scripts and record their dialogue then running these student films through text to animation software so they can see their work come to life people who today dont have the time or money to do more than write or unable to get their screenplay more than a glance by people online can actually get their movies made we could see a potential explosion in content much like how the internet has already seen an explosion in artwork music and writing

China Opens A New Era In Blockchain History,3,"*In 2020 the main world news about blockchain and cryptocurrency come mainly from China, whose policy in this sphere was already called “super-aggressive”. Mining state calls blockchain the main innovative technology, they say it fuels the competitive environment for the crypto business and connects large bankers and telecommunications giants.*

On April 18, 2020, the Agricultural Bank of China launched a test application for using the national cryptocurrency. The acronym “DCEP” (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) is increasingly discussed in the analytic community. The app became available in test mode in large cities of the country.

The system created by the Agricultural Bank includes two types of digital currency. The first is the currency for commercial banks. The second is the issue of digital money for individuals and legal entities by commercial banks. 

Although mobile payments through Alipay and WeChat Pay have been used in the daily life of the Chinese for a long time already, the government made another step and created a new cryptocurrency.

The digitalization of the global financial Chinese system and the widespread adoption of blockchain technology – that is a future caused by the actions of China, which initially remained wary of such initiatives.

## A little bit of history

In October 2019 Xi Jinping, the President of China announced that the development of blockchain technology is one of the state’s priority tasks and called for boosting the development of this sphere in the country. It was heard by the grapevine that China started developing its own cryptocurrency in early 2014. The news about new crypto periodically popped up, although according to the experts, the country was more associated with strict regulatory actions. The industry was even included in the preliminary list of industries that should be banned and some blockchain conferences were closed by the police.

Much has changed with the release of Libra (Facebook cryptocurrency). Facebook is a private company with 2.3 billion users worldwide and the prospect of issuing its own currency could potentially turn the project into the main global cryptocurrency.

China took this as an incentive. First of all, an incentive to push the dollar out of the electronic payment market, and in the future, to change the entire global financial system. Looking at the example of China, and realizing what opportunities might be missed, many other countries have announced the development of their CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency). For example, the European Central Bank, the Central Bank of South Korea, Russia, Sweden, and several other countries talk about their own developments in the field of state cryptocurrencies.

Forbes has placed the launch of the DCEP in the first place on the list of the most influential events that will determine the blockchain ecosystem in 2020.

However, China has always been the largest cryptocurrency miner. Huge mining farms and some of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges are based here. And while Xi Jinping’s statement was logical and expected, official support from the authorities led to major investments and blockchain research. The Chinese telecommunications giants have been given the green light to freely innovate. In fact, they were given tremendous power. Immediately after the October announcement, shares of Chinese technology companies rose significantly, as well as Bitcoin prices. Requests for the term “blockchain” in the Chinese searching engines have grown up 60 times.

## Blockchain Bonds

The scale of China’s actions is huge nowadays. One of China's largest commercial banks, Bank of China (BoC), issued blockchain bonds for $2.8 billion. Two-year bonds will go on sale with an interest rate on the coupon of 3.25% per annum.

The Bank of China intends to direct the raised funds to support small and medium-sized businesses. Entrepreneurs will be able to obtain loans at lower rates since the blockchain system allows the bank to reduce the cost of issuing and circulating debt instruments.

## What positive changes will the project bring?

The introduction of the DCEP system will help the People's Bank of China reduce the cost of issuing money. It will also help reduce the commercial banks’ costs in transactions, improve the business climate in the field of innovation, and minimize risks. When making an interbank transfer using the new currency, users will not be charged a transaction fee. DCEP will allow us to make transfers within the country and abroad easily. It is most likely that the DCEP platform will have more opportunities and advantages. Now the world needs to accept the fact that the monetary and financial system has entered a new era.

 A car company that no longer has any middle class buyers can adapt to having fewer customers by *ridiculously* jacking up their prices.

How can we make cinema more ephemeral in the future? Or it is now impossible?,3,"I have since become obsessed with the idea of ephemerality and the arts. The idea that music, literature, painting, sculpture, and film can be immortalized by the archival process. Those art forms allow people to hold onto tangible and physical representations whereas performance art is noticeably fleeting and transient.

It got me thinking about cinema and its origins. In the early days of cinema, enthusiasts could only watch films via cinemas. If you didn't go to the cinema, you couldn't watch the film. If you didn't manage to catch the film during its theatrical run, that was it.

**You missed your opportunity.**

Whereas now; with video-on-demand, Blu-ray / DVD, and torrents, you can rewatch your favorite films anytime. I must say, I am very much a romantic when it comes to this aspect of cinema. I like the idea of the fleeting cinematic experience.

One of my favorite cinematic experiences in the last few years was watching Dunkirk on 70MM IMAX. Because even though I knew it would be released on disc / online, there was a very good chance I would not be able to watch the film in that capacity again. That made the experience ephemeral to me.

If I missed the theatrical release at IMAX and simply watched it on DVD or online, I would be watching 50% of the film.

I'm not the one to enjoy binge-watching on Netflix or any kind of DVD. I love the idea going to the cinema as I hate watching films on my laptop. 

I want the biggest screen possible.

As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I have thought extensively of ways I would make my future films more ephemeral.

I play with the idea of releasing films only theatrically. Every so often hosting a Livestream of the film online and that's it. I like the idea of reducing the accessibility to increase the ephemera. Obviously, this is the kind of stunt you can only really do when you're a household name.

So, is this now a futile exercise against the dominant on-demand culture or will the value of cinematic ephemerality be affirmed in the future?

in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza,
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

Will 3 Billion People Really Live in Temperatures as Hot as the Sahara by 2070?,3, ,Futurology,will billion people really live in temperatures as hot as the sahara by  
These Facebook theorists are funny... *long microchip/Bill Gates post*,7,"This entire microchip theory is based on Bill Gates using the term “digital certificate”. 

“ID2020” is a US based company. Established in 2016 they make digital identities, which are computerised records of people stored in a registry - not microchips. 

The microchips that people have decided to link to them regardless are called RFID chips. I read theorists themselves saying “you’ll have a microchip in your arm soon!”. No, they’re implanted between the forefinger and thumb at about the size of a grain of rice.

RFID chips have data pre-installed on them. They need to be scanned at close proximity to be read where in this case they’d give a reading of whether or not you’ve been vaccinated. They’re not a GPS device. As the data is PRE-installed it means they already have the data, rendering the point of billions spent on the implants, and the continuation of billions spent on the implants for every single human born forevermore, completely pointless. 

If this really was all down to wanting to watch you then they’d be better off spending the money on billions of security cameras, giving them more information than the dot from GPS ever would... 

“Hi GPS dot, are you killing someone there, I can’t see? Hmm never mind, you were the only person there. But wait, who’s to say another wasn’t there that has cut out there GPS dot...? Hmm....” 

“Hi camera, thanks for letting me know this person is killing someone there”.

But hey, assuming they were a GPS device, any scan would return no reading at all like an RFID chip would do and so their plan would be busted in hours. The “chip” would have to be a lot bigger for both components to be fitted to try and hide the GPS device, raising suspicions before even being implanted.

They’d need to manufacture and implant more than 7.78b chips to even start, before performing approx. 5 implants per second for the rest of time. So they need to try and get on top of the current population while an extra 5 are born per second... So they’d be doing constant implants on newborns, which in itself would cause havoc, with a constant stream of billions being spent on the continuous manufacturing of chips so that there’s never a shortage in any hospital around the world.

Assuming it was gone ahead with though, the chip wouldn’t just magically start interacting with flesh and bone. If 5G was somehow involved it could do nothing more than wirelessly retrieve the info from the chip. It’d be like slicing a hole in your arm, putting your iPhone into it, stitching yourself back up and then controlling your iPhone on a second screen. Even if they upped their game and decided that they’re going to somehow install an operating system into us that the chip could then “talk” to, it still wouldn’t interact with flesh and bone. It would be like putting your PC inside you...

But let’s assume it could be done. Let’s say they can get a monitor, PC, operating system and an RFID chip for £1 each. That would be £31.12b for just those. At £1 each... Then let’s assume there’s 1,000,000 staff members watching those screens who would be assigned more than 70,780 people each to watch. It’d be hard to keep on top of 20 each... Let’s give them a salary of £20k. that’s another £20b a year. So we’re just starting and we’re at £51.12b with £20b wages every year for the staff members they couldn’t physically have. Looking at monitors online briefly, the average cheapest I can find is £60. Let’s say Gates can get 75% off for the sake of argument. £15b just like that. That’s assuming there’s 1 billion of them with the monitors divided into 8... 1 screen each? £116.7b for the current population (more than Bill Gates owns...).

Then let’s count the people they’d need to implant the chips. They’d need enough in each hospital just to be sure as they don’t know where or when a child will be born, if there’ll be more than one at a time or if there’ll be some angry mothers holding things up. So most will be stood there being paid to do nothing... but let’s account for 3 surgeons per hospital and one hospital per city around the world. 4416 x 3 x £20k. Another £264.96m a year for this department who stand around doing nothing, not accounting for the many more hospitals we’re missing. Then there’s the staff that’d have to watch those surgeons to make sure they are where they say there are considering how easy it’d be to skive. If they were watching just via GPS and they weren’t where they said, what could they do? Send a new employee to try again taking days and missing loads of implants...?

So we’re at about 1,020,000 staff in 2 departments... Imagine IT for those 1-8billion computers, damn! But anyway...

102,000,000,000.00 USD (Bill Gates’ approx. fortune) equals 82,457,554,800.00 GBP.

Bill Gates’ $102b has reduced to £31.07b in the first year. 2 departments. Next years salaries from these 2 departments would take that remaining £31.07b to £10.8b... even halving their salaries would take it to £20.9b. For the rest of their lifelong plan...

“But Bill Gates is backed by others!” - Even if they agreed to use every penny available in the world and nobody but them had money anymore it would only last until that money’s run out before the world is broke and they’d need trillions/quadrillions (from where? Everyone would have sacked off their jobs not earning anything) to be able to get on top of it again, in turn missing the implants of billions, rendering the plan a fail.

“But Bill Gates is going to take some money from Microsoft!!” - no, with the constant stream he’d need, the company he founded would be too greatly affected.

This is basic maths. Please bear in mind that the above was done assuming that everything would cost just £1. The cheapest pet RFID transponder I can find on Amazon after a quick browse is £6.99. £6.99 for each chip would make it £54.38b for just the chips of the current population... So you’ve got approx. £28b left for the rest of this lifelong plan before even getting to the staff of the 2 departments mentioned before this...

This is all before taking into consideration that even if it was mandatory, millions of people would cut it back out and destroy it, resulting in billions extra being spent to figure out who cut it out and where they are just so they can constantly spend on travel costs to get back to them for it to be re-implanted in those millions/billions who will just do it again anyway. So billions spent over and over on those who wouldn’t comply and all for a chip that wouldn’t give them any information at all in comparison to their phone.

“But it’s down to Starlink!!” - Let’s say for the sake of argument that no PC’s or monitors are needed and Starlink somehow does it all. My low cost of surgeon’s salaries and the manufacturing of £1 RFID chips would leave Bill Gates broke in less than 8 years. Let’s sack off the surgeons though, let’s train existing surgeons at no extra cost. Taking our chips back to the still low £6.99 each and again, £54.38b of £82.4b gone at the very first step of the lifelong plan...

Russia and China, being examples, would never accept a phone call from America saying “hi, we’ve developed a microchip and have decided on your behalf that all of your citizens are going to have it implanted into their bodies for us to monitor them and steal information. We’re sending members of our companies with the appropriate defence to your countries now, comply or we’ll use force because it’s mandatory but if you attack us then we’ll attack you potentially resulting in war”. Yeah... no. If it’s not all America’s choice and it’s down to each country saying yes and sorting it out themselves then literally just one country has to say the word “no” and the system is broken anyway as the whole planet wont have their microchips, which again could result in war for the disagreeing country(s). If they did all say yes? Read from the top again. $$$...

We’d never be forced to buy them, that makes it optional, not mandatory. They’d just run out of money a tiny bit slower than if we weren’t paying, due to the slow income of those who can buy them once and once only, but they’d ultimately still run out of money with how many people wouldn’t do it. 

“They’re releasing an app to track us!!” - No, that’s a non-mandatory app that exchanges codes with anybody with the same app that you’ve been close to. If one of those people mark themselves as sick then their app sends your app a notification, due to the earlier code exchanging, so you’re aware you may be at risk. Don’t want it? Don’t get it. Assuming you were right though, it actually pisses on your microchip theory... they’ve achieved it via an app instead, good on them.

Quantum dot tattoos? - “These dots are essentially molecule-sized particles engineered to have unique structures that react to near-infrared light in a way that could theoretically be identified by a device such as a smartphone. It is physically impossible to implant a quantum dot sized device that could actively ping location or any other data to an unknown third party. This sort of research, if it ever came to fruition in the first place, is in its infancy, and would be years away from actual implementation anywhere, let alone in a potential COVID-19 vaccine that scientists estimate could be available potentially within 18 months”.

A mandatory microchip isn’t coming. But if it was optional and free? Did you do 9,999,999 backflips in your garden today? That’s how optional it would be. But again, $$$... 

Unless they physically forced every single person on the planet to pay for these chips (not possible - not everybody has money and they’d be more inclined to say no than before now with a price on it) then they’re going to collapse.

“But it’s a hoax!! It’s to cut the population and take more control!!” - We saw the “success” Hitler had with World War II before his ultimate failure. Why didn’t they just stage World War III? Most of the men shipped off to instantly die for years and the public in lockdown for years... Just bomb their own cities for further population control while they kill their own men on the beaches they shipped them off to. More control and population control just like that. Governments are “evil” after all? But no... let’s do it slowly through a “fake” virus...

“The virus was manufactured!! They did it on purpose!!” - Then why not just make a contagious cure to get around their problem of the anti-vaxxers and completely unknown to them they’ll have had the vaccine just like they’ll have had the virus? Na, let’s do it a way in which the conspiracy theorists can outsmart us, DAMN they’re good...

“But Bill Gates wants to make money, that’s why!!” - He could put one foot into Microsoft and spunk money for a living for the rest of his days (not that he needs money). But ok, it’s about money...

“Bill Gates owns a patent for coronavirus that he bought in 2015!!“ - No, an institute in which he helps to fund owns one for a TYPE of coronavirus which primarily affects chickens and could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent respiratory diseases in birds, such as IBV. Heres a quick description of IBV: “Avian coronavirus is a coronavirus that infects birds, causing the associated disease avian infectious bronchitis. It is a highly infectious avian pathogen that affects the respiratory tract, gut, kidney and reproductive systems of chickens.”

Here’s the patent, free for anyone to view online. Go to page 18 for part 1 which instantly talks about IBV, IB and birds:  

You can Google “pirbright institute patent coronavirus” to have a further two documents show, both of which start discussing bird diseases on page 2.

“They’ve edited the text, we know it’s about covid-19!!” - then how do you know what you read hasn’t been edited to feed you yourself false information? The things you’re arguing are real could be regarding something completely different and have just been edited to suit your theory...

“You’re wrong, we’ve cracked him!!” - You think that the genius, Bill Gates, is going to conduct a worldwide evil plan but not think of doing it in a different name? The nerd of all computers can’t make a fake profile? That thing that would take any of us less than 5 minutes to do on any website? Does it all in his own name and just places the evil plan on the internet for you all to read without any need for even an attempt at hacking? Leaving that patent online for people, not remembering he should delete it now the next step of his worldwide plan has begun? The founder and ex-owner of Microsoft...? MAN, you’ve cracked him... If he genuinely had an evil plan then there’s more chance of him pissing himself laughing at you for spreading this fake plan that he planted himself which actually covers his real plan.

“No, they’re not using a microchip, they’re using the vaccine to insert microscopic GPS modules to track us!!” - the likes of deodorant, being a basic example, is absorbed into the body. Why not just make you do it yourselves via things like that rather than make their “evil plan” known and have to physically fight against you due to you all say no...?

“But Event201 happened proving it’s fake!!” - Event201 was a meeting for world leaders to pretty much discuss what would be done in such a pandemic. This pandemic coincidentally started not long after. It’d be like going to a garage and asking what to do if you get a puncture, driving away and then getting a puncture. Ahhhh, aliens!

“But the pineal gland in your brain is a gateway to the afterlife and all of this is being done to damage the gland so you can’t get to the afterlife!!” - the main man I see sharing this story locally shares videos of a man called Simon Parkes who convinces his followers of this. Parkes was an Icke follower so believes in this reptilian nonsense. While he makes these videos, his official website has affiliate links to a website that sells USB sticks for £283 each or £799 for 3 to “protect you from 5G” so you’re still able to get to the afterlife anyway. He is scaring you to believe his rubbish so you then go and buy USB sticks through his website for upto £799... 

Conspiracy theorists read memes online and then share that fake news. I read one the other day referring to “toxic vaccines”. So poisonous vaccines? Rendering the point of this “manmade virus” pointless anyway as they’d just force the mandatory toxic injection in? The creator also didn’t realise that “Main Stream” was a single word... It didn’t stop this person sharing it to the next people though.

It’s been 51 years since the moon landings this year. Upto 18,615 days. The US alone still haven’t admitted a single thing. But people believe they’ve cracked the entire world’s plan in 30-45 days and think they’re going to bend over for them... “that guy in his basement cracked us via YouTube, we’re screwed!!”

around the world  x x k another  m a year for this department who stand around doing nothing not accounting for the many more hospitals were missing then theres the staff thatd have to watch those surgeons to make sure they are where they say there are considering how easy itd be to skive if they were watching just via gps and they werent where they said what could they do send a new employee to try again taking days and missing loads of implants so were at about  staff in departments imagine it for those billion computers damn but anyway    usd bill gates approx fortune equals    gbp bill gates b has reduced to  b in the first year departments next years salaries from these departments would take that remaining  b to b even halving their salaries would take it to b for the rest of their lifelong plan but bill gates is backed by others even if they agreed to use every penny available in the world and nobody but them had money anymore it would only last until that moneys run out before the world is broke and theyd need trillions quadrillions from where everyone would have sacked off their jobs not earning anything to be able to get on top of it again in turn missing the implants of billions rendering the plan a fail but bill gates is going to take some money from microsoft no with the constant stream hed need the company he founded would be too greatly affected this is basic maths please bear in mind that the above was done assuming that everything would cost just the cheapest pet rfid transponder i can find on amazon after a quick browse is   for each chip would make it  b for just the chips of the current population so youve got approx b left for the rest of this lifelong plan before even getting to the staff of the departments mentioned before this this is all before taking into consideration that even if it was mandatory millions of people would cut it back out and destroy it resulting in billions extra being spent to figure out who cut it out and where they are just so they can constantly spend on travel costs to get back to them for it to be re implanted in those millions billions who will just do it again anyway so billions spent over and over on those who wouldnt comply and all for a chip that wouldnt give them any information at all in comparison to their phone but its down to starlink lets say for the sake of argument that no pcs or monitors are needed and starlink somehow does it all my low cost of surgeons salaries and the manufacturing of rfid chips would leave bill gates broke in less than years lets sack off the surgeons though lets train existing surgeons at no extra cost taking our chips back to the still low  each and again  b of b gone at the very first step of the lifelong plan russia and china being examples would never accept a phone call from america saying hi weve developed a microchip and have decided on your behalf that all of your citizens are going to have it implanted into their bodies for us to monitor them and steal information were sending members of our companies with the appropriate defence to your countries now comply or well use force because its mandatory but if you attack us then well attack you potentially resulting in war yeah no if its not all americas choice and its down to each country saying yes and sorting it out themselves then literally just one country has to say the word no and the system is broken anyway as the whole planet wont have their microchips which again could result in war for the disagreeing country s if they did all say yes read from the top again  wed never be forced to buy them that makes it optional not mandatory theyd just run out of money a tiny bit slower than if we werent paying due to the slow income of those who can buy them once and once only but theyd ultimately still run out of money with how many people wouldnt do it theyre releasing an app to track us no thats a non mandatory app that exchanges codes with anybody with the same app that youve been close to if one of those people mark themselves as sick then their app sends your app a notification due to the earlier code exchanging so youre aware you may be at risk dont want it dont get it assuming you were right though it actually pisses on your microchip theory theyve achieved it via an app instead good on them quantum dot tattoos these dots are essentially molecule sized particles engineered to have unique structures that react to near infrared light in a way that could theoretically be identified by a device such as a smartphone it is physically impossible to implant a quantum dot sized device that could actively ping location or any other data to an unknown third party this sort of research if it ever came to fruition in the first place is in its infancy and would be years away from actual implementation anywhere let alone in a potential covid vaccine that scientists estimate could be available potentially within months a mandatory microchip isnt coming but if it was optional and free did you do  backflips in your garden today thats how optional it would be but again  unless they physically forced every single person on the planet to pay for these chips not possible not everybody has money and theyd be more inclined to say no than before now with a price on it then theyre going to collapse but its a hoax its to cut the population and take more control we saw the success hitler had with world war ii before his ultimate failure why didnt they just stage world war iii most of the men shipped off to instantly die for years and the public in lockdown for years just bomb their own cities for further population control while they kill their own men on the beaches they shipped them off to more control and population control just like that governments are evil after all but no lets do it slowly through a fake virus the virus was manufactured they did it on purpose then why not just make a contagious cure to get around their problem of the anti vaxxers and completely unknown to them theyll have had the vaccine just like theyll have had the virus na lets do it a way in which the conspiracy theorists can outsmart us damn theyre good but bill gates wants to make money thats why he could put one foot into microsoft and spunk money for a living for the rest of his days not that he needs money but ok its about money bill gates owns a patent for coronavirus that he bought in  no an institute in which he helps to fund owns one for a type of coronavirus which primarily affects chickens and could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent respiratory diseases in birds such as ibv heres a quick description of ibv avian coronavirus is a coronavirus that infects birds causing the associated disease avian infectious bronchitis it is a highly infectious avian pathogen that affects the respiratory tract gut kidney and reproductive systems of chickens heres the patent free for anyone to view online go to page for part which instantly talks about ibv ib and birds you can google pirbright institute patent coronavirus to have a further two documents show both of which start discussing bird diseases on page theyve edited the text we know its about covid  then how do you know what you read hasnt been edited to feed you yourself false information the things youre arguing are real could be regarding something completely different and have just been edited to suit your theory youre wrong weve cracked him you think that the genius bill gates is going to conduct a worldwide evil plan but not think of doing it in a different name the nerd of all computers cant make a fake profile that thing that would take any of us less than minutes to do on any website does it all in his own name and just places the evil plan on the internet for you all to read without any need for even an attempt at hacking leaving that patent online for people not remembering he should delete it now the next step of his worldwide plan has begun the founder and ex owner of microsoft man youve cracked him if he genuinely had an evil plan then theres more chance of him pissing himself laughing at you for spreading this fake plan that he planted himself which actually covers his real plan no theyre not using a microchip theyre using the vaccine to insert microscopic gps modules to track us the likes of deodorant being a basic example is absorbed into the body why not just make you do it yourselves via things like that rather than make their evil plan known and have to physically fight against you due to you all say no  but event happened proving its fake event was a meeting for world leaders to pretty much discuss what would be done in such a pandemic this pandemic coincidentally started not long after itd be like going to a garage and asking what to do if you get a puncture driving away and then getting a puncture ahhhh aliens but the pineal gland in your brain is a gateway to the afterlife and all of this is being done to damage the gland so you cant get to the afterlife the main man i see sharing this story locally shares videos of a man called simon parkes who convinces his followers of this parkes was an icke follower so believes in this reptilian nonsense while he makes these videos his official website has affiliate links to a website that sells usb sticks for each or for to protect you from g so youre still able to get to the afterlife anyway he is scaring you to believe his rubbish so you then go and buy usb sticks through his website for upto  conspiracy theorists read memes online and then share that fake news i read one the other day referring to toxic vaccines so poisonous vaccines rendering the point of this manmade virus pointless anyway as theyd just force the mandatory toxic injection in the creator also didnt realise that main stream was a single word it didnt stop this person sharing it to the next people though its been years since the moon landings this year upto  days the us alone still havent admitted a single thing but people believe theyve cracked the entire worlds plan in  days and think theyre going to bend over for them that

A thought about entropy and the future of theoretical physics. Could what I explained in the second paragraph work? Does anyone know how much energy it takes to find the number of quanta in a molecule and how much it changes said energy?,4,"Throughout history, everyone has had an idea of how the universe works, how it began, and how it will end. But everyone has been proven wrong, only modern theories still standing. But these theories have not existed for long. How can we truly say we are right? Especially when these modern theories compete. Someday we will likely have completely new theories, and who knows if they might violate conservation of energy, allowing humanity to exist pretty much perpetually. But we just confine ourselves to a limited view, ignoring what might be.

Plus, even with the current theories, entropy is just the statistical thing that makes it so that stuff gains more order, leaving less energy available. It is technically possible for a candle to get hotter, increasing the energy available and putting entropy in the system in reverse. It just is extremely, extremely unlikely because of how big a candle is. But on a subatomic scale, it happens all the time. If given two subatomic to molecular batteries with the exact same amount of energy, (putting the system in a state of perfect entropy) it not unlikely for them to fluctuate, putting more energy on one side. If you had a machine that could detect this change, then when it does detect the change, the machine would know it is statistically likely for the energy to move back to a state of perfect entropy, or at least closer, and since all of our energy is harnessed through the energy in space with a state of high energy moving to a space with a state of low energy (entropy) (e.g, when a piston in a car causes an explosion in the chamber, creating a state of high energy, which pushes the piston because that energy wants out into the state of lower energy that is the air), you could theoretically generate electricity from this likely movement, thereby generating electricity from nothing.",Futurology,a thought about entropy and the future of theoretical physics could what i explained in the second paragraph work does anyone know how much energy it takes to find the number of quanta in a molecule and how much it changes said energy throughout history everyone has had an idea of how the universe works how it began and how it will end but everyone has been proven wrong only modern theories still standing but these theories have not existed for long how can we truly say we are right especially when these modern theories compete someday we will likely have completely new theories and who knows if they might violate conservation of energy allowing humanity to exist pretty much perpetually but we just confine ourselves to a limited view ignoring what might be plus even with the current theories entropy is just the statistical thing that makes it so that stuff gains more order leaving less energy available it is technically possible for a candle to get hotter increasing the energy available and putting entropy in the system in reverse it just is extremely extremely unlikely because of how big a candle is but on a subatomic scale it happens all the time if given two subatomic to molecular batteries with the exact same amount of energy putting the system in a state of perfect entropy it not unlikely for them to fluctuate putting more energy on one side if you had a machine that could detect this change then when it does detect the change the machine would know it is statistically likely for the energy to move back to a state of perfect entropy or at least closer and since all of our energy is harnessed through the energy in space with a state of high energy moving to a space with a state of low energy entropy e g when a piston in a car causes an explosion in the chamber creating a state of high energy which pushes the piston because that energy wants out into the state of lower energy that is the air you could theoretically generate electricity from this likely movement thereby generating electricity from nothing

I feel people are underreacting to OpenAI's Jukebox. This neural network is generating waveforms themselves!,30,"The [technology in question](  and [one of the more famous outputs]( 

The best part is that it's synthesizing the songs via waveform generation.

Traditional synthetic music would typically do it by splicing together different notes (and thus humans would actually play the music), through MIDI files, or by playing digital instruments (like synth guitars and drums in FL Studios). We've been doing this for *decades*. 

Anyone who used the internet or played video games in the 90s and 2000s remembers MIDI files being everywhere. [And Ray Kurzweil himself literally pulled off the first *in 1965*]( 

AI *composing* music has been around for a long time indeed, and even generating itself has been possible for a good long while. Since before I was born, at least. But never like this.

This does it another way entirely: it creates music by literally generating the audio waveforms, which is insane. When I was a bit younger, I figured that an AI could potentially do this— I knew that my own voice was just a waveform and editing that waveform could turn it into anything. I remember opening up Audacity files of various tracks that had audio glitches that I couldn't remove without messing with the music or voices, wishing there was some way to play with those waveforms. I'd zoom in as close as I could until the waveform was just a slightly curved line, play with a tiny bit of that line, and marvel at how totally that changed what that segment sounded like. This resulted in me imagining what it'd be like to have an AI be able to understand audio waveforms well enough to intelligently manipulate them to the extent that it could generate novel music, voices, and sounds. I knew it was possible. But I didn't think we'd pull it off by 2020.

To use an analogy, you know of lab-grown/in vitro meat? It's one of several different types of alternative meat, the most famous being meatless vegan meat (which isn't half bad). However, meatless meat is made from plants and treated to have the taste and consistency of meat. They're not meat at all. No fibers, no muscles, no fat; nothing. 

In vitro meat *is* meat. It's grown through different methods, but it still grows as meat cells— muscles, tendons, fat, maybe even bones eventually. Just without the animal attached. Both synthetic, but one is actually what it's pretending to be. 

That's this in a nutshell. 

When you hear a guitar in a Jukebox-generated song, you're *actually hearing a guitar*, even though no physical guitar was ever played. It's not a MIDI file of a guitar, nor is it a prerecording or rough synthetic version. We're hearing the raw audio of a guitar. 

This is because the neural network is essentially ""imagining"" what a guitar sounds like. I use that word loosely, of course. But you do it similarly in your head. You've heard what a guitar sounds like, likely in many different ways. And if I asked you to imagine the guitar-driven part of, say, ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" you could probably do it easily. Same deal with the piano parts. And you're probably remember the drums, bass, and vocals without even being prompted. 

And if I asked you to imagine Freddy Mercury sing the entire song in falsetto or for the band to rerecord the song but turn the piano sections into future-funk but left the heavy rock parts intact (or perhaps even vice versa), you could probably imagine it easily as well.

That's what Jukebox is doing.


I already knew neural networks could do this— [WaveNet showed off this capability back in 2016, using its audio waveform generation to synthesize voices and piano](  I was simply waiting for the day this was combined and translated into full musical pieces. And now it's here.

Almost.

The Jukebox tracks were apparently hell to render, taking hours just to make a single minute. But it won't be long before we have the ability to generate any sort of song— including mash-ups, hybrids, remixes, and remakes in any style.


My long dream of an AI-generated barbershop quartet cover of TLC's *Waterfalls* &amp; a female-fronted Witchfinder General is taking shape.


But that's just the present.

This is clearly just in its infancy, to the point that it suffers from the ""[S-curve effect](  older methods, including MIDI generation (think of MuseNet, also from OpenAI) obviously sound better than this because they have so much refinement, whereas Jukebox's songs all occupy the auditory uncanny valley, as if we're picking up songs from an alternate universe through a shortwave radio. Furthermore, these tracks only resemble their parents songs on the surface— dig any deeper, and you'd realize that the AI doesn't seem to know how to pull off a verse-chorus-verse or loop verses (so it'd make for good art punk probably). As admirable as it is, it still leaves a lot to be desired. 

But these will all be solved with just a little bit more compute and work. Indeed, by the end of this year, it might be exponentially better than it already is. And within five years, we'd have a ""music generator"" that could easily handle any request. 


Actually, not just music generator. ANY sound could be generated. It's all audio waveforms, after all.


#**TLDR, OpenAI stuns us once again by unveiling the first generation of an AI that can generate any sound by directly generating raw audio waveforms rather than making a MIDI file or composing notes for humans to play**

This means we can hear a computer generate music electronic music... I know that sounds redundant, but I mean that this would basically synthesize the sound of synthesizers rather than playing those synthesizers itself.

"Only click on this if you have a very good idea of what entropy is, also a warning, really long post.",6,"Does nobody think? Throughout history, everyone has had an idea of how the universe works, how it began, and how it will end. But everyone has been proven wrong, only modern theories still standing. But these theories have not existed for long. How can we truly say we are right? Especially when these modern theories compete. Someday we will likely have completely new theories, and who knows if they might violate conservation of energy, allowing humanity to exist pretty much perpetually. But we just confine ourselves to a limited view, ignoring what might be.

Plus, even with the current theories, entropy is just the statistical thing that makes it so that stuff gains more order, leaving less energy available. It is technically possible for a candle to get hotter, increasing the energy available and putting entropy in the system in reverse. It just is extremely, extremely unlikely because of how big a candle is. But on a subatomic scale, it happens all the time. If given two subatomic to molecular batteries with the exact same amount of energy, (putting the system in a state of perfect entropy) it not unlikely for them to fluctuate, putting more energy on one side. If you had a machine that could detect this change, then when it does detect the change, the machine would know it is statistically likely for the energy to move back to a state of perfect entropy, or at least closer, and since all of our energy is harnessed through the energy in space with a state of high energy moving to a space with a state of low energy (entropy) (e.g, when a piston in a car causes an explosion in the chamber, creating a state of high energy, which pushes the piston because that energy wants out into the state of lower energy that is the air), you could theoretically generate electricity from this likely movement, thereby generating electricity from nothing.",Futurology,only click on this if you have a very good idea of what entropy is also a warning really long post does nobody think throughout history everyone has had an idea of how the universe works how it began and how it will end but everyone has been proven wrong only modern theories still standing but these theories have not existed for long how can we truly say we are right especially when these modern theories compete someday we will likely have completely new theories and who knows if they might violate conservation of energy allowing humanity to exist pretty much perpetually but we just confine ourselves to a limited view ignoring what might be plus even with the current theories entropy is just the statistical thing that makes it so that stuff gains more order leaving less energy available it is technically possible for a candle to get hotter increasing the energy available and putting entropy in the system in reverse it just is extremely extremely unlikely because of how big a candle is but on a subatomic scale it happens all the time if given two subatomic to molecular batteries with the exact same amount of energy putting the system in a state of perfect entropy it not unlikely for them to fluctuate putting more energy on one side if you had a machine that could detect this change then when it does detect the change the machine would know it is statistically likely for the energy to move back to a state of perfect entropy or at least closer and since all of our energy is harnessed through the energy in space with a state of high energy moving to a space with a state of low energy entropy e g when a piston in a car causes an explosion in the chamber creating a state of high energy which pushes the piston because that energy wants out into the state of lower energy that is the air you could theoretically generate electricity from this likely movement thereby generating electricity from nothing

The four stages of culture shock.,5,"Wikipedia. No matter what the technology is, it always goes over this way.

Stage 1 - honeymoon. You're a future-boo. You're loud, enthusiastic, and garish. Every feature is used to its most ugly and ornate possible extent. Geocities was is a great example of this. The technology is still in its early stages, so it's primitive. If contagion can spread with the assistance of the technology, then the contagion is at its most virulent at this point. The first adopters are science, pornography, and the military. House spouses with recipes also fit in here.

Stage 2 - negotiation. Everything goes to a reactionary hell, people want to go back to the status quo ante. The Future has its external enemies, and whoever is the most backward is the one to fight them. Past-boos rally the nation against the nations in which other past-boos rule. In this case, you have situations in which the Christian right rallies the country against Islam, and Islamists rally the Ummah against Christendom. The market realizes in earnest that the technology has bugs or doesn't work, and if and when it does work, it's realized as misused. The stock market valuation of tech stocks specializing in the new technology collapses. The new technology is decried as something that was never meant to be. The language barrier becomes the major problem, and a secondary problem is physical health, it becomes difficult to eat the food, drink the water, and find the right meds.

Stages 3 and 4 - adjustment and adaptation. 60% of the population reject the new technology, but they can never go back, because they'll have problems there as well. The rejectors form ghettos. 10% of the population take to the new technology completely.

Expect the Unexpected,6,"I have looked through many futuristic predictions of old. Before 1946, not a single prediction I can find included computers. Not one of the brilliant minds of the first half of the 20th century could foresee machines that could perform arithmetic millions of times faster than humans or store libraries worth of data in one's pocket.

This is a rather extreme example, but it highlights how futurists can be spectacularly wrong in their predictions. And if we were too pessimistic about technology in the 20s and 30s, then we became far too optimistic in the 60s. Herbert Simon in 1965 said that by 1985 “machines will be capable of doing any work a man can do.” But as it turned out, replicating the intelligence of man was far harder than predicted and to this day scientists are working how to make AI as intelligent as a 5 year old. 

As it turns out, 10% probabilities don't equal 0% probability. In 1989, Census demographer Gregory Spencer was quoted by the New York Times as saying ""We will be wrong"". His bureau had released a forecast projecting that America's population would peak at 302 million in the year 2038 and then start declining. They couldn't have predicted that in the 90s, millions of Mexicans fleeing their country's shattered economy would send America's population growth rate soaring. 

So where does that leave us? Predictions about the impacts of climate change need to take into account how we'll be living by the end of the century. Just like the hand wringers of Victorian Era London who worried that within a few decades, their city would be flooded with manure by the ever growing population of horses, doommongers today don't think about how today's worries could be obsolete by 2100. In the same way those Londoners failed to foresee the automobile, they don't see that we won't worry about droughts or pests because we'll be eating synthetic food and that robust means of weather control will bring hurricanes to heal.",Futurology,expect the unexpected i have looked through many futuristic predictions of old before  not a single prediction i can find included computers not one of the brilliant minds of the first half of the th century could foresee machines that could perform arithmetic millions of times faster than humans or store libraries worth of data in ones pocket this is a rather extreme example but it highlights how futurists can be spectacularly wrong in their predictions and if we were too pessimistic about technology in the s and s then we became far too optimistic in the s herbert simon in said that by  machines will be capable of doing any work a man can do but as it turned out replicating the intelligence of man was far harder than predicted and to this day scientists are working how to make ai as intelligent as a year old as it turns out probabilities dont equal probability in  census demographer gregory spencer was quoted by the new york times as saying we will be wrong his bureau had released a forecast projecting that americas population would peak at million in the year and then start declining they couldnt have predicted that in the s millions of mexicans fleeing their countrys shattered economy would send americas population growth rate soaring so where does that leave us predictions about the impacts of climate change need to take into account how well be living by the end of the century just like the hand wringers of victorian era london who worried that within a few decades their city would be flooded with manure by the ever growing population of horses doommongers today dont think about how todays worries could be obsolete by  in the same way those londoners failed to foresee the automobile they dont see that we wont worry about droughts or pests because well be eating synthetic food and that robust means of weather control will bring hurricanes to heal

Solar Power Satellite - SPS-ALPHA,4,"The [new X-37B spacecraft mission](  will experiment on the reaction of materials to the conditions in space, the effects of radiation on seeds, and transformation of solar power into radio frequency microwave energy, to, possibly, transmit it to Earth.

The last experiment got me thinking about its practical use, to which I found a [NASA report](  that specified several aspects of  ""The First Practical Solar Power Satellite via Arbitrarily Large Phased Array"".

As I'm not familiar with engineering, I had difficulty extracting the information I was searching. To avoid a probably very bad case of misreading, I'm here to ask someone interested and knowledgeable in the subject. Here are my questions:

**a. From this report, how much energy they expect to collect from space?**

**b. What's the efficiency of the transmission of that energy to earth? Bigger than we can usually do here?**

**c. How much usable energy is received on Earth?**

**d. I read from the report that the cost of energy would be cheaper compared to other sources, but how much cheaper?**

**e. How would that distribution happen? I suspect that there wouldn't be many receptors, so only a few places could use it, at least for now.**

**f. Ideas for the use of this source. I saw a comment that referred to extremely cold and distant places that had difficulty in maintaining a source of energy throughout the year. Maybe Arctic and Antarctic exploration.**

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe there isn't enough information in the report to answer all the questions, especially the last ones.

\- Some cars are self-driving, but not everyone can afford one so there are still actual drivers

\- I have two robots that are like Google Home cranked up. They are red and white orbs that connect into various things and become the brains to make things operate. The robots communicate with smart contracts back and forth.

\- The orb connects to the car and drives, the orb connects to the kitchen to cook and clean

Top Futurology News - For the month of April 2020,1,"**We hope you enjoy this month's update!**

Here are the top stories from the past month (in mostly chronological order):

1) [Artificial Intelligence Cannot Be Inventors, US Patent Office Rules]( 

*An AI system called DABUS ""invented"" two new devices, but the USPTO says only humans can do that. On Monday, the United States Patent and Trademark Office* [*published a decision*](  *that claims artificial intelligences cannot be inventors. Only “natural persons” currently have the right to get a patent.*

2) [Brain-decoding Computer Can Restore This Important Human Sense]( 

*The feeling of grass beneath your fingertips, warm sand under your feet, the pain of getting too close to a fire: the world is full of sensations that we often take for granted. But for people who have suffered* [*spinal cord injuries (SCI,)*](  *and there are* [*approximately 288,000*](  *of them in the United States alone, losing their sense of touch can greatly impact how they interact with the world around them. New research in the field of* [*brain-computer interfaces*](  *could make this devastating loss of sensation reversible.*

3) [30,000 tiny sensors fit within the size of a penny - Can transmit data from living tissue]( 

*Theologians once pondered how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. Not to be outdone, Cornell researchers who build nanoscale electronics have developed microsensors so tiny, they can fit 30,000 on one side of a penny. There’s more to these tiny sensors than just their diminutive size: They are equipped with an integrated circuit, solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that enable them to harness light for power and communication.*

4) [China Rolls Out Pilot Test of Digital Currency]( 

*China’s central bank has introduced a homegrown digital currency across four cities as part of a pilot program, marking a milestone on the path toward the first electronic payment system by a major central bank.*

5) [3D imaging reveals inner workings of an ""off-switch"" for cancer]( 

*One of the ways the human body can fight off cancer cells is through enzymes known as protein phosphatases, which act as a brake to slow cancer growth. Molecules can be used to ramp up the activity of these enzymes, and through advanced imaging technique scientists have now identified the binding sites they use to do the job, revealing how novel drugs could be used to activate this “off-switch” and keep the disease in check.*

6) [Folding@Home Now More Powerful Than All the Supercomputers on Earth]( 

*The past six weeks have seen a lot of unprecedented activity across the globe, most of it bad. One bright spot in the gloom — though of course, a rather conditional one — has been the sudden explosion in computational power being flung at analyzing and understanding COVID-19. It wasn’t that long ago we were reporting on the Folding@Home network’s record-breaking 1.5 exaFLOPS of performance. Now, the system has broken 2.5 exaflops. At that speed, it’s reportedly faster than the sustained performance of all Top500 supercomputers combined.*

7) [New handle for controlling electromagnetic properties could enable spintronic computing]( 

*Materials scientists at Duke University have shown the first clear example that a material's transition into a magnet can control instabilities in its crystalline structure that cause it to change from a conductor to an insulator. If researchers can learn to control this unique connection between* [*physical properties*](  *identified in hexagonal iron sulfide, it could enable new technologies such as spintronic computing. The results appear April 13 in the journal Nature Physics.*

8) [Stanford researchers devise treatment that relieved depression in 90% of participants in small study]( 

*Stanford Medicine researchers used high doses of magnetic stimulation, delivered on an accelerated timeline and targeted to individual neurocircuitry, to treat patients with severe depression. A new form of magnetic brain stimulation rapidly relieved symptoms of severe depression in 90% of participants in a small study conducted by researchers at the* [*Stanford University School of Medicine*]( 

9) [Self-powered X-Ray detector to revolutionize imaging for medicine, security and research]( 

*2-D perovskite thin films boost sensitivity 100-fold compared to conventional detectors, require no outside power source, and enable low-dose dental and medical images.  A new X-ray detector prototype is on the brink of revolutionizing medical imaging, with dramatic reduction in radiation exposure and the associated health risks, while also boosting resolution in security scanners and research applications, thanks to a collaboration between Los Alamos National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory researchers.*

10) [Researchers present revolutionary light-emitting silicon]( 

*Breakthrough after 50 years of work paves the way for photonic chips. Emitting light from silicon has been the ‘Holy Grail’ in the microelectronics industry for decades. Solving this puzzle would revolutionize computing, as chips will become faster than ever. Researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology now succeeded: they have developed an alloy with silicon that can emit light. The results have been published in the journal Nature. The team will now start creating a silicon laser to be integrated into current chips.*

11) [Researchers Create AI-Powered Blood Test to Detect Cancer]( 

*Cancer is one of the most common causes of death, but the huge variation in types of cancer can make early detection a challenge. A team of researchers from the US has developed a blood test that might be able to help identify early-stage tumors using the power of AI. The test can* [*detect over 50 different cancers*](  *and narrow down tumor location to specific areas of the body.* ",Futurology,top futurology news for the month of april  we hope you enjoy this

[AMA] We're Sebastian &amp; Karl from SAGA Space Architects. We're here to talk about our unfolding Moon Habitat that we will test for 3 months in isolation in the Arctic this fall - Ask us anything!,30,"Hi, Futurologists!

We’re two Danish architects who’ve designed a Moon Habitat that can unfold like origami and expand its inner volume by 560%! It’s not ready for the Moon yet, but we’ll test it over 3 months in Arctic Greenland.  We will live like astronauts in total isolation, testing the Habitat, our bodies, and our minds. Essentially, we’re testing ways to make extreme isolation + hostile environments livable for humans, not just military-trained astronauts.

The project is completely independent of any big organizations and we are building the Habitat ourselves here in Copenhagen.

The ultimate goal would be to see our habitat on the surface of the Moon since we believe the future of space travel must not be just survival, but instead that space should be full of life.

A lot of the facts about the mission and habitat are on our project website: [   
We also posted an [Imgur story](  a while back with some nice details.

We’d be very interested in hearing your questions and thoughts about psychology in space travel, but feel free to ask anything about the project as well!

The future of music in an A.I. augmented world,6,"I've been browsing through this music that was created by a neural network.
 
It got me thinking about the future as a musician. In my mind you could get a decent rig to run this algorithm. Then set up a studio where local musicians could come in, and do whatever they can do musically. That might be something as limited as doing some vocal samples with half finished lyrics. You could then mix what they did with other music like what they want to do, and see what comes out. 

Many musicians may look at this sample collection with deep horror. The music it produces is after all passable, and the automatically generated lyrics aren't entirely horrible in all cases. I could see believing that individual musicians might not be able to compete with A.I. generated music, but I think that we are more flexible then that. I'm old enough to remember when electronic music was going to be the death of live performances, and that hasn't happened. In my mind this is just another step in the same direction.

"Futurology Request: Diverse village in Northern South Africa looking at community development strategies, networking platforms for future cohesion.",6,"I grew up in a small farming community that has great potential, as long as we find ways to communicate and work well together.

I am interested on finding different community design strategies that we can develop the structure to lead us through these uncertain times and be better off in the future.

I am interested in the modern ways of bringing people with initiative together that function well in other communities ( i.e. EU Smart Villages program) and combining them with existing neighbouring structures that surround us (Tribal Chiefs and councils, local government etc).

During the pandemic is a good time to begin with most people are at home during these uncertain times and there is a willingness to work together against a faceless enemy or the consequences of the economic impact it is going to have. 

Our main concerns at the moment and for the future:
- Leadership and Structure (We have no mayor and almost non existent central leadership or network to design our future.) 
- Gathering initiative (We have many young parents and individuals that have it in their interest to be involved in deciding our future but don't seem to want to be involved yet.) 
- Crime (Especially backlash from desperate people as a result of COVID lockdown.)
- Environment (Acknowledging and protecting the diverse fauna and flora in our area.)
- Water (Mitigating the distribution of our water that will Definitely be the biggest problem of the future.)
- Community having a backbone against large corporations that we can decide a future that is in the best interest of the village, its people and the environment. 

50 years ago villagers met in the town hall perhaps quarterly, now with mobile communication more often tend to stick to their own. 

In the last few years the Neighbourhood Watch has been a very good catalist to bringing farmers together, communication is mostly on WhatsApp and isn't always the best method when we have a wide array of topics, perhaps a forum type platform can have more diverse topics or themes. 

I am looking for any resources or tips especially from other small communities around the world that have worked out. Any sources of all the thought that humanity has spend of understanding what works with inter-/intra-community relationships/leadership methods and networking strategies. 

What makes it really exciting is that we can look into all the resources available and try out what works best that we can develop ourselves with what is existing and if we find something that works the blueprint can be shadowed on neighbouring communities.

The foolish decisions of the generations before 1980 are soon to be inherited by the younger generations however; the newest generations are the most prepared and adaptive for the new world after twenty-thirty. Over the past one hundred years we have long-failed to fight the fact of the environment's total breakdown and the effects it would have. The new era of humankind is coming, the hardest hundred years in human history but despite that fact, the technology required to fix the issues on earth may be as dangerous as the problems themselves. The future of mental and physical health often brings uneasiness to me, as mental health plummets for younger generations, and human augmentation allows for people to replace their flesh with metal. The religious doctrine will also collapse Christianity and Islam will lower in popularity significantly, causing a new age in religious practice.

The human species is at this moment completely susceptible to environmental change, due to near unadaptivity to the world of unpredictable storms and mass death to weather phenomena. Earth’s temperature is rising. It is an ever-escalating threat and it will cause the majority of human problems as well as environmental toxicity, damaging the ecosystem and pushing humans out of highly polluted areas. Subsequent to these problems are their effects that will highly damage the animal population as well as agriculture, leading to famine.

By 2030 Automatic Vehicles or autos will control almost all movement of goods, from humans to ores in a pit mine. The majority of a company's budget is spent on human labor and by 2030, all transport jobs are gone. In 2040 almost all jobs are gone. Companies will have robots doing the majority of blue-collar work, and artificial intelligence doing the majority of white-collar work. This creates a massive infrastructure of artificial intelligence communicating and trading information on miles and miles of servers. Almost all humans will become unemployable by no fault of their own. The systems fall apart as the economy breaks. Fixing these complications in the systems can be fixed by adding a universal basic human income, and a more highly structured system, based around the net of bots.

Mental and physical health are real concerns in the future even if it continues to be ignored by most. Depression is rising in teens and young adults suicide has increased by 56% percent in the past two decades. Human augmentation, gene therapy, and designer children are both haunting and intriguing which bring on a sense of anxious excitement. Those technologies will stop the majority of diseases including old age as gene therapy will likely have the technology in the next sixty years.

Religious practice has been falling over the past decades, however, religious practice will continue into the new age of humankind in a new form with new groups. Christianity and Islam are dying, as well as the majority of other religious groups. The Religious groups Most likely to survive past 2100 are Neopaganism, Atheism, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. The religious group with the highest chance of surviving hasn’t been founded yet. It would have a base of Athopaganism with Animalistic symbolic deities, that symbolize real different parts of human thought and condition, with the Community of Judaism with a much more adaptive system of religious practice. My goal is to create such a religious group and to steer it to its survival in the future of the human species.

How would UFO propulsion technology possibly work?,28,"In the light of the Pentagon declaring the legitimacy of the UFO videos, yesterday (28 April, 2020), I was curious how these things work.

 Bob Lazar said he worked on a highly secret US military program to reverse engineer the propulsion system in one of the UFOs that US military has in Area 51. He said he worked on the Energy and Propulsion division of the project. Bob describes that he was studying a device that was the size of a basketball that could manipulate gravity. The device powered on when it was placed on top of a pedestal that could be the power source. 

Bob also said that the device defied our notions of physics. The device doesn't produce any heat as a waste product while producing gravity (anti gravity infact), violating the First Law of Thermodynamics (which actually isn't a law because it doesn't arise mathematically, but is an axiom based out of our observations of the Universe). He also explains that when the military tested the UFOs by flying it (I'm not kidding), it could do manoeuvres like ping pong balls. Meaning, inertia doesn't apply to the UFOs, it was seperated from the rest of reality, which could be because of the device. If you can manipulate gravity, you can manipulate reality. 

What are your thoughts about this?

## Introduction

Although aquatic animal cell lines from embryonic and other lineages have been successfully established and studied, this field is in its infancy compared to cell culture from terrestrial vertebrates. In particular, a full-scale optimization of media composition has not been performed for any aquatic species. Here, previous cell culture studies from aquatic species are discussed in order to glean insights regarding what components are likely or unlikely to be necessary in an optimized, animal component-free formulation suitable for producing cultivated seafood. Comparisons of *in vivo* nutritional requirements and meat composition for aquatic and terrestrial species are also referenced, although due to potential limited translatability between *in vivo* and *in vitro* characteristics, such comparisons should be considered qualitative in nature.

Media composition is considered separately for fish embryonic stem (ES)-like cells, other fish cells, and cells from crustaceans. The term ES-like cells is used because while some of the lines mentioned have been shown to express multiple ESC markers and to exhibit other stem cell-like characteristics such as forming embryoid bodies, others have been less fully characterized. ES-like cells should be understood to include both ESCs and other cells that may be partially differentiated.

Optimizing culture media for aquatic species is a tractable problem, made easier by the plethora of research already available from terrestrial species. However, much work is still needed to actually perform systematic optimizations of the concentrations of various components for [teleost fish](  [crustaceans](  and other aquatic taxa. Still further optimization will be required to fine-tune media composition for specific species and cell types. Specific strategies for optimization will be explored in the next part of this series.

## Comparison of culture media for ES-like cells from fish and mammals

Compared to mammalian cell culture, much less is known about the *in vitro* requirements of fish cells. The most common media formulation used to grow fish ES-like cell lines was originally developed for [medaka](  cells, a small fish commonly used as a research model organism.[1](  This formulation, called ESM1 in the original publication, includes not only [fetal bovine serum](  (FBS) but also fish serum and fish embryo extract. Two recombinant human growth factors, [FGF2](  (also known as bFGF) and [LIF](  are included as well. A comparison of ESM1 and some of its derivatives with the serum-free [Essential 8](  (commonly known as E8)[2](  and B8[3](  formulas optimized for human ESC and iPSC culture reveals several similarities and differences (Table 1).

All formulations are based on common basal media such as [DMEM](  [L-15](  or a mixture of one or both of these with [F12](  and contain buffers, some form of antioxidant or reactive oxygen species scavenger, and a source of [selenium](  ions. They contain either the same or similar recombinant growth factors. LIF, included in ESM1, and [TGFβ](  included in E8, might play a similar role to one another, as it has been shown that treatment with TGFβ induces robust expression of LIF in glioblastoma cells.[4](  Similarly, treatment of explants from the developing rat kidney with either LIF or TGFβ induced expression of LIF as well as a modest increase in expression of TGFβ.[5](  [NRG1](  included only in B8, enhances growth but is not required.[3](  E8 and B8 contain two components with no direct analog in ESM1: [transferrin](  and [insulin](  In addition, E8 and B8 contain substantially higher concentrations of sodium selenite and FGF2 than ESM1. ESM1, unlike E8 and B8, contains FBS, fish serum, and fish embryo extract. These animal-derived components serve as sources of transferrin, insulin, selenium, and FGF2 (or analogs thereof), and thus at least some of these components will likely be required in order to produce optimized serum-free media.

[**Table 1**](  Comparison of E8, B8, and several media formulations used to culture fish ES-like cells. Components not separated by a horizontal line are those likely to substitute for one another, due to playing a similar function or interacting with similar receptors or signaling pathways. Bold borders indicate that the publication reported directly testing the effect of this component on fish cell growth and finding a positive effect. Double borders indicate components (besides basal media) shown to be essential, rather than simply growth-enhancing, although the essentiality of TGFβ is apparent only in long-term growth assays.[3](  Color scales for β-mercaptoethanol, selenium, FGF2, FBS, and fish serum  facilitate visualization of concentration differences between formulations. Question marks indicate that the publication did not state a concentration for the reported component. Note that the B8 media formulation uses the thermostable variant [FGF2-G3](  so its effective concentration in the media may be higher than it appears relative to other publications. Antibiotics and buffers are not shown. Also see Dash et al. 2010.[6]( 

## What is not needed for culture of fish ES-like cells?

Most publications using fish ES-like cells employ media formulations based on ESM1. The only successful instance of serum-free culture of fish ES-like cells was in medaka, and was achieved by supplementing DMEM with [IGF2](  This formulation, while able to support growth, did not perform as well as the control formulation, which contained all the same components as ESM1 except for LIF, and was not tested for its ability to support long-term culture. An essential step in identifying optimized media formulations for use in fish stem cell culture will therefore be the identification of the additional components of serum and embryo extract that are necessary and sufficient for optimal growth of fish stem cells in animal-free media. The composition of naturally-occurring serum is described in detail in [part B](  of this series. Identification of a set of components that can support robust growth of fish ES-like cells in the absence of serum will require careful testing of a number of candidates and optimization of their respective concentrations.

Some components of ESM1 are frequently omitted in other studies, and therefore can probably be deprioritized in attempts to find optimized animal-free formulations. The growth factor LIF was used only during early passages in the original publication,[1](  and is one of the components most commonly omitted in other studies,[8](  suggesting that it may not be essential at least in some species or lines. In an ES-like line from [Indian major carp](  LIF was shown to stimulate growth and to help maintain an undifferentiated state, although both effects were quite modest when tested in the presence of other growth factors.[6](  ESM1 contains [glutamine](  [pyruvate](  and [non-essential amino acids](  (NEAA) as additional nutrient sources, but cells from [turbot](  [olive flounder](  [barramundi](  and [haddock](  have been successfully cultured without these supplements.[11](  Glutamine was also omitted in studies of ES-like cells from [Japanese sea bass](  and [red seabream](  consistent with the glutamine independence of mammalian ESCs mentioned in [part A]( 

Two studies are notable outliers: ES-like cell lines from barramundi[13](  and haddock[14](  were both successfully cultured in L-15 with 15-30% FBS. However, systematic comparisons to media containing recombinant growth factors, fish serum, and embryo extract were not performed, so it cannot be concluded that L-15 with FBS was sufficient for *optimal* proliferation. Although elimination of FBS needs to be the eventual goal when it comes to cultivated meat and seafood, the fact that some fish ES-like cells from common food species will grow in the absence of fish serum or embryo extract is encouraging because it suggests that ES-like fish cells recognize and require the same growth factors that have already been well characterized for serum-free culture of non-aquatic cell lines. Unfortunately, the three ESM1 components that will be essential to replace for cultivated seafood applications are consistently used across all (FBS) or most (fish serum, fish embryo extract) studies of ES-like cells from food-relevant fish species.

## Requirements for serum and growth factors

It is unclear to what extent the necessity of each of these components has been systematically tested in most of the above-mentioned studies. The importance of FGF2 and FBS in [cod](  and of FGF2, FBS, and fish serum in turbot[11](  were experimentally demonstrated by subtracting these individual components from the complete medium. The reverse strategy — adding specific components to a minimal medium — revealed that, for carp ES-like cells, fish embryo extract and FGF2 were the most capable of supporting growth when added individually to basal media containing NEAA and sodium pyruvate, while FBS, LIF, and fish serum had weaker effects.[6](  Differences in growth factor concentration requirements both between fish and terrestrial cells and between fish cells of different species may result not only from the intrinsic growth factor requirements of these cells but also from differences in growth factor stability at different temperatures.[19](  Since serum is a complex mixture of proteins, peptides, and other molecules, identifying the minimal set of components that can substitute for serum will be a key challenge. Below, several candidate serum components that could be necessary for optimal survival and proliferation of fish ES-like cells are discussed. Many of these are routinely used for serum-free culture of mammalian ESCs, and were discussed in further detail in [part B](  of this series.

## Role of insulin and insulin-like growth factors in fish

Although [zebrafish](  have been demonstrated to respond to human insulin and to develop insulin resistance in a similar manner to mammals when exposed to high doses,[20](  insulin’s effects on fish stem cell proliferation are thus far unclear. However, the related insulin-like growth factors [IGF1](  and IGF2 have been better studied in this context. Moderate levels of IGF1 supplementation led to a modest increase in growth of a [fibroblast](  [catfish](  cell line[21](  The medaka ESC line HX1 showed a dramatic change in morphology and loss of expression of stem cell markers when transitioned from media similar in composition to ESM1, described above, to DMEM alone. Both of these effects were largely rescued when the cells were transitioned to DMEM containing IGF2.[7](  Further, in the same study, DMEM with IGF2 was able to support derivation of [blastomeres](  although slightly less efficiently than control media. In contrast, IGF1 showed only a very weak ability to stimulate proliferation and was unable to support maintenance of an undifferentiated state in Indian major carp.[6](  It is unclear whether this reflects a difference between IGF1 and IGF2 or a species difference. Insulin, because of its demonstrated ability to support growth of mammalian ESCs, and/or IGFs, because of their ability to improve survival and proliferation in fish, are likely to be necessary components of any serum replacement strategy. It is unclear to what extent insulin, IGF1, and IGF2 may be able to substitute for one another, since all three are known to interact with multiple receptors and to overlap in their receptor specificities, albeit with substantially different affinities.[22](

## Role of transferrin and iron in fish

Transferrin is involved in the regulation of iron metabolism in both fish and other vertebrates by binding to free iron ions. This both prevents them from causing formation of reactive oxygen species, and simultaneously increases the availability of iron at appropriate sites within cells[25](  As in other vertebrates, iron is an essential micronutrient in fish. The dietary iron requirement for Atlantic salmon was estimated as [60 mg iron per kg of diet](  similar to the [50 mg/kg of diet recommended for beef cows](  with iron-deficient salmon developing hypochromic microcytic [anemia](  It is important to bear in mind that these numbers are based on the whole organism, and reflect the needs of many cell types. Raw Atlantic cod contains [0.38 mg of iron per 100 g serving](  lower than [raw steak, 1.85 mg per serving](  or raw chicken, with [0.92 mg per serving in light meat](  and [1.22 mg per serving in dark meat](  Other fish are more comparable to terrestrial species, such as [raw skipjack tuna, 1.25 mg per serving](  Such quantitative differences in iron requirements or accumulation may reflect species differences in cellular requirements for iron, differences in how easily iron is absorbed, or some combination of these two factors. However, the fact that both iron and its carrier transferrin appear to behave similarly between fish and terrestrial vertebrates suggests that they may be similarly required in cell culture media, albeit possibly at different concentrations. In other words, addition of transferrin to fish stem cell media is likely to be beneficial. [DMEM already contains ferric nitrite](  but the optimization of the iron concentration specifically for culture of fish ES-like cells could also yield improved results.

## Selenium requirements in fish

Selenium is present in E8 media at a concentration of 80 nM[2](  This concentration may not be high enough for maximal growth; further optimization of E8 led to the B8 formulation, in which selenium is included at a concentration of 116 nM[3](  In contrast, concentrations between 2 nM and 8 nM have been used for culture of fish ES-like cells, and some studies use no defined selenium source at all (see Table 1). It is possible that cellular requirements for selenium are different between fish and mammals, so it is worth considering what is known about the requirements for selenium in fish. Selenium requirements vary substantially across fish species, [from 0.03 mg/kg of diet recommended for salmonids to 0.7 mg/kg of diet for juvenile grouper](  The recommended minimum selenium dosage for beef cows is [0.1 mg/kg of diet](  within the range recommended for various fish species. Fish also accumulate selenium within their muscles. The selenium content for raw Atlantic cod is higher, at [33.1 μg per 100 g serving](  than that of [raw steak, 21.1 μg per serving](  or raw chicken, whether [light meat, 17.8 μg per serving](  or [dark, 13.5 μg per serving](  As with transferrin, there is no obvious reason why selenium would not be required for fish stem cell media in similar concentrations as for cells from terrestrial vertebrates. Identifying the optimum level for any given fish species should be part of any serum replacement strategy.

## Choice of buffering agent

Standard practice in culturing fish ES-like cell lines is to maintain cultures under ambient CO2 conditions and to rely on HEPES as the primary buffering agent. One study found that chick ESC cultures were negatively impacted by the presence of HEPES or other zwitterionic buffers,[26](  but it is unknown whether the same effects are likely in fish cells, and if so at what concentrations. Systematic testing of various buffering agents might be helpful to find ideal culture conditions for fish ES-like cells.

## Implications for serum-free culture of fish ES-like cells

The combination of factors that will allow for replacement of serum and other animal-derived components for fish ES-like cells while supporting optimal proliferation rates, and their optimal concentrations, is currently unknown. A good starting point will be to test the components shown to be capable of replacing serum in terrestrial vertebrate cell culture: selenium, transferrin (potentially in conjunction with adjustment of iron concentrations), insulin, and various growth factors. IGF2 in particular is a strong candidate, as its addition to the media can support serum-free culture of medaka ESCs, albeit with a reduction in growth rate compared to conventional media.[7](  It is likely that the addition of other components together with IGF2 will allow for high and sustained proliferation rates of fish ES-like cell cultures without animal-derived ingredients.

## Media for non-embryonic fish cells

In general, published media formulations for non-embryonic cells from fish are somewhat simpler than most of those discussed above, although they also typically contain FBS and suffer from a similar lack of systematic optimization. Primary cultures from muscle (presumably containing a mixture of [myocytes](  [myosatellite cells](  and other cell types) of [rainbow trout](  and [gilthead sea bream](  have been initiated using DMEM with 15% horse serum, and subsequently cultured in 10% FBS.[27](  Under these conditions, cells fused and eventually formed large [myotubes](  over the course of 10 to 15 days.[28](  A continuous cell line with an epithelial-like morphology isolated from [southern bluefin tuna](  was successfully maintained over 8 months in L-15 containing 10-20% FBS.[30](  Concentrations of FBS below 10% resulted in reduced proliferation rates. Human FGF2 was included during isolation and early passages, but whether it affected survival or proliferation was not assessed. Serum-free culture of ovarian cells from channel catfish has been achieved by gradual reduction in the serum concentration present in the media.[31](  Although this cell type is not likely to be relevant to cultivated meat, the strategy of gradually adapting cells to serum-free conditions may be applicable to other cell types.

Of note, zebrafish and some other fish species lack the gene for inositol-3-phosphate synthase. As a result, inositol has been considered as an essential nutrient in models of zebrafish metabolism,[32](  whereas it is non-essential in mammals. *Myo*\-inositol has been identified as a dietary requirement for optimal growth in carp, tilapia, and parrot fish,[33](  although it is worth noting that only the latter species lacks the inositol-3-phosphate synthase gene. In the absence of exact measurements of the activity of these various homologues, it is worth keeping in mind that optimization of inositol levels may be an important step in developing optimized basal media for fish, and that this optimization may need to be performed on a species-by-species basis.

## Amino acid requirements in fish

Amino acid requirements in terrestrial species were discussed in [part A](  of this series. *In vivo*, the same amino acids are essential in most tested fish species[36](  as in humans. The exception is arginine, which is essential *in vivo* in fish but only essential *in vitro* in human cells. Quantitative dietary amino acid requirements of a number of fish species may serve as useful guides for researchers attempting to optimize cell culture media for particular fish species, but it is unclear how direct the translation between quantitative *in vivo* and *in vitro* requirements will be. Amino acid requirements of various Mediterranean fish species[37](  and of salmonids[38](  have been reviewed in detail. Which amino acids, if any, are required *in vitro* but not *in vivo* in fish species is unknown. The successful growth of medaka ESCs in DMEM supplemented with only IGF2[7](  suggests that the *in vitro* essential amino acids are likely similar between fish and mammals, although this leaves room for differences in optimal concentrations. Amino acid concentration may be an important factor in species-specific optimization of media for both embryonic and non-embryonic fish cell lines, especially in cases where minimizing the cost of media is essential. However, it may not be necessary in order to achieve the goal of finding a media formulation that works reasonably well for culturing cells from most fish species.

## Osmolality

Teleost fish maintain the [osmolality](  of their extracellular fluids within a fairly narrow range of around 300 mOsm/kg by actively either taking in (for freshwater fish) or excreting (for marine fish) salt.[39](  This is close to [DMEM’s osmolality of between 310 and 360 mOsm/kg](  Consistent with this, the fish cell culture studies cited above do not deliberately adjust osmolality, and media used to culture cells from Nile tilapia,[9](  which is [restricted to fresh or brackish water](  is of a similar formulation to those used for cells from marine species. The exception to this is fish which are [osmoconformers](  meaning that the osmolality of their extracellular fluids matches that of their environment. Osmoconformers are rare among aquatic vertebrates, but include elasmobranchs and hagfish.[39](  Mesenchymal stem cells from shark embryos were successfully cultured in media with a lower solute concentration (in this case expressed as osmolarity) than adult cartilaginous fish plasma, an observation that may be related to the fact that the fluid within the egg contains a lower solute concentration than the surrounding seawater.[40](  Culture of cells from osmoconforming species may thus require an explicit consideration of osmolality as it relates to both species and the life stage from which the cell line was derived.

## Media for crustacean cell culture

In general, the *in vivo* requirements for most minerals between fish and aquatic crustaceans are fairly similar, with some important differences.[41](  Additionally, it may be possible to learn some lessons from [insect cell culture](  due to the [close evolutionary relationship](  between these groups. As in vertebrates, selenium is thought to be required by [shrimp](  and potentially other crustaceans, although a precise value for the requirement has not been reported. Although evidence for regulated transport and storage of iron has been observed in crustaceans, no evidence for iron deficiency in shrimp has been reported. This is consistent with the fact that crustaceans primarily rely on the copper-containing [hemocyanins](  rather than iron-containing [hemoglobin](  for oxygen transport. Indeed, most [malacostracans](  (a group that contains both shrimp and [crabs](  lack hemoglobin entirely.[42](  Consistent with this, the dietary copper requirements for shrimp may be between 6-fold and 35-fold higher than those for fish, depending on the species.[41](  It is unclear whether crustaceans’ lower iron and higher copper requirements reflect only differences in oxygen transport mechanisms or if requirements of individual cells will also follow the same trend under culture conditions. Besides iron, the only minerals recommended for inclusion in feed formulations for fish but not for shrimp or lobster are iodine and manganese.[41](  However, these are most likely required only for the proper functioning of particular organs or systems, rather than generally required by cells (whether fish or land animals), and are [not included in the standard DMEM formulation](  In summary, iron and copper deserve special attention when adapting media formulations from fish to crustaceans because of their vastly different roles in these organisms. However, oxygen transport, the role for which these minerals are best appreciated, works very differently in culture compared to *in vivo*, so it is unclear how well whole-organism dietary requirements will translate to requirements of single cells.

Many attempts have been made at culturing cells from shrimp, with some success, yet continuous cell lines have not yet been reported in the academic literature. However, the wealth of studies performed on primary cells provides some insights into what media formulations show promise.[43](  In general, it seems that shrimp cells are adaptable to a variety of basal media formulations, but which is the most successful seems to be dependent on the cell type in question. Osmolalities used were higher than that of DMEM, ranging from 472 to 760 mOsm/kg. FBS has generally been found to support growth of shrimp cells, but may not be sufficient for optimal growth. Various extracts from shrimp or related species are often, but not always, helpful. FBS and [chitosan](  both supported growth of cultures initiated from shrimp embryos, and a combination of FGF2 and IGF2 further stimulated proliferation.[44](  An extensive review of cell culture studies in shrimp has been published elsewhere,[43](  and includes discussion of both basal media formulations as well as supplements such as FBS and various shrimp extracts. Despite the challenges reported in establishing shrimp cell lines, the [shrimp dumplings demonstrated by Shiok Meats](  in early 2019 point to the feasibility of culturing shrimp cells for the purpose of creating a cultivated food product.

Primary cells from crab [hepatopancreas](  were successfully cultured in 3x concentrated L-15 buffer reconstituted in artificial seawater.[45](  Viability of these cells was reduced in the presence of FBS or various crab extracts. However, these negative effects of FBS are likely cell type-dependent rather than species-dependent. Primary crab [hemocytes](  grew well in 2x concentrated L-15 with amino acid-sugar supplement and 15% FBS.[46](  Similarly, 2x L-15 with 10% FBS was successfully used to grow crab eyestalk neurons, whereas 5% FBS was found to be insufficient to support survival.[47]( 

## Conclusion

Optimized, low-cost, animal component-free media formulations for use with seafood-relevant species are desperately needed in order to move cultivated seafood from a promising idea to an economically viable solution to the environmental, ethical, and food security problems associated with current methods of seafood production. Fortunately, there is a wealth of data on the nutritional needs of seafood species and their biological differences from common terrestrial species raised for meat. In addition, successful optimization projects for mammalian cells[3](  can provide a roadmap for those attempting similar goals in seafood species. Serum-free culture of medaka ESCs has been demonstrated,[7](  although further optimization is needed to reduce costs, increase proliferation rates, and find formulations adapted to seafood-relevant species. These studies will take time and effort, but there is a clear path ahead towards the optimized media formulations needed to make cultivated seafood a reality. The potential effects of media composition on nutritional and organoleptic properties of cultivated seafood products, independently of differences in cellular proliferation, will be discussed in Series V for both seafood and terrestrial meat.

concluded that l with fbs was sufficient for optimal proliferation although elimination of fbs needs to be the eventual goal when it comes to cultivated meat and seafood the fact that some fish es like cells from common food species will grow in the absence of fish serum or embryo extract is encouraging because it suggests that es like fish cells recognize and require the same growth factors that have already been well characterized for serum free culture of non aquatic cell lines unfortunately the three esm components that will be essential to replace for cultivated seafood applications are consistently used across all fbs or most fish serum fish embryo extract studies of es like cells from food relevant fish species requirements for serum and growth factors it is unclear to what extent the necessity of each of these components has been systematically tested in most of the above mentioned studies the importance of fgf and fbs in cod and of fgf fbs and fish serum in turbot  were experimentally demonstrated by subtracting these individual components from the complete medium the reverse strategy adding specific components to a minimal medium revealed that for carp es like cells fish embryo extract and fgf were the most capable of supporting growth when added individually to basal media containing neaa and sodium pyruvate while fbs lif and fish serum had weaker effects  differences in growth factor concentration requirements both between fish and terrestrial cells and between fish cells of different species may result not only from the intrinsic growth factor requirements of these cells but also from differences in growth factor stability at different temperatures  since serum is a complex mixture of proteins peptides and other molecules identifying the minimal set of components that can substitute for serum will be a key challenge below several candidate serum components that could be necessary for optimal survival and proliferation of fish es like cells are discussed many of these are routinely used for serum free culture of mammalian escs and were discussed in further detail in part b of this series role of insulin and insulin like growth factors in fish although zebrafish have been demonstrated to respond to human insulin and to develop insulin resistance in a similar manner to mammals when exposed to high doses  insulins effects on fish stem cell proliferation are thus far unclear however the related insulin like growth factors igf and igf have been better studied in this context moderate levels of igf supplementation led to a modest increase in growth of a fibroblast catfish cell line  the medaka esc line hx showed a dramatic change in morphology and loss of expression of stem cell markers when transitioned from media similar in composition to esm described above to dmem alone both of these effects were largely rescued when the cells were transitioned to dmem containing igf  further in the same study dmem with igf was able to support derivation of blastomeres although slightly less efficiently than control media in contrast igf showed only a very weak ability to stimulate proliferation and was unable to support maintenance of an undifferentiated state in indian major carp  it is unclear whether this reflects a difference between igf and igf or a species difference insulin because of its demonstrated ability to support growth of mammalian escs and or igfs because of their ability to improve survival and proliferation in fish are likely to be necessary components of any serum replacement strategy it is unclear to what extent insulin igf and igf may be able to substitute for one another since all three are known to interact with multiple receptors and to overlap in their receptor specificities albeit with substantially different affinities  figure supplementation of basal media with increasing amounts of igf c f results in a partial rescue of the morphological changes of medaka escs transitioned from serum containing media a to unsupplemented serum free media b igf also partially rescues the viability of these cells g measured as mean fluorescence intensity mfi of alamarblue from yuan amp hong   role of transferrin and iron in fish transferrin is involved in the regulation of iron metabolism in both fish and other vertebrates by binding to free iron ions this both prevents them from causing formation of reactive oxygen species and simultaneously increases the availability of iron at appropriate sites within cells  as in other vertebrates iron is an essential micronutrient in fish the dietary iron requirement for atlantic salmon was estimated as mg iron per kg of diet similar to the mg kg of diet recommended for beef cows with iron deficient salmon developing hypochromic microcytic anemia it is important to bear in mind that these numbers are based on the whole organism and reflect the needs of many cell types raw atlantic cod contains  mg of iron per g serving lower than raw steak  mg per serving or raw chicken with  mg per serving in light meat and  mg per serving in dark meat other fish are more comparable to terrestrial species such as raw skipjack tuna  mg per serving such quantitative differences in iron requirements or accumulation may reflect species differences in cellular requirements for iron differences in how easily iron is absorbed or some combination of these two factors however the fact that both iron and its carrier transferrin appear to behave similarly between fish and terrestrial vertebrates suggests that they may be similarly required in cell culture media albeit possibly at different concentrations in other words addition of transferrin to fish stem cell media is likely to be beneficial dmem already contains ferric nitrite but the optimization of the iron concentration specifically for culture of fish es like cells could also yield improved results selenium requirements in fish selenium is present in e media at a concentration of nm this concentration may not be high enough for maximal growth further optimization of e led to the b formulation in which selenium is included at a concentration of nm in contrast concentrations between nm and nm have been used for culture of fish es like cells and some studies use no defined selenium source at all see table it is possible that cellular requirements for selenium are different between fish and mammals so it is worth considering what is known about the requirements for selenium in fish selenium requirements vary substantially across fish species from mg kg of diet recommended for salmonids to mg kg of diet for juvenile grouper the recommended minimum selenium dosage for beef cows is mg kg of diet within the range recommended for various fish species fish also accumulate selenium within their muscles the selenium content for raw atlantic cod is higher at  g per g serving than that of raw steak  g per serving or raw chicken whether light meat  g per serving or dark  g per serving as with transferrin there is no obvious reason why selenium would not be required for fish stem cell media in similar concentrations as for cells from terrestrial vertebrates identifying the optimum level for any given fish species should be part of any serum replacement strategy choice of buffering agent standard practice in culturing fish es like cell lines is to maintain cultures under ambient co conditions and to rely on hepes as the primary buffering agent one study found that chick esc cultures were negatively impacted by the presence of hepes or other zwitterionic buffers  but it is unknown whether the same effects are likely in fish cells and if so at what concentrations systematic testing of various buffering agents might be helpful to find ideal culture conditions for fish es like cells implications for serum free culture of fish es like cells the combination of factors that will allow for replacement of serum and other animal derived components for fish es like cells while supporting optimal proliferation rates and their optimal concentrations is currently unknown a good starting point will be to test the components shown to be capable of replacing serum in terrestrial vertebrate cell culture selenium transferrin potentially in conjunction with adjustment of iron concentrations insulin and various growth factors igf in particular is a strong candidate as its addition to the media can support serum free culture of medaka escs albeit with a reduction in growth rate compared to conventional media  it is likely that the addition of other components together with igf will allow for high and sustained proliferation rates of fish es like cell cultures without animal derived ingredients media for non embryonic fish cells in general published media formulations for non embryonic cells from fish are somewhat simpler than most of those discussed above although they also typically contain fbs and suffer from a similar lack of systematic optimization primary cultures from muscle presumably containing a mixture of myocytes myosatellite cells and other cell types of rainbow trout and gilthead sea bream have been initiated using dmem with horse serum and subsequently cultured in fbs  under these conditions cells fused and eventually formed large myotubes over the course of to days  a continuous cell line with an epithelial like morphology isolated from southern bluefin tuna was successfully maintained over months in l containing  fbs  concentrations of fbs below resulted in reduced proliferation rates human fgf was included during isolation and early passages but whether it affected survival or proliferation was not assessed serum free culture of ovarian cells from channel catfish has been achieved by gradual reduction in the serum concentration present in the media  although this cell type is not likely to be relevant to cultivated meat the strategy of gradually adapting cells to serum free conditions may be applicable to other cell types of note zebrafish and some other fish species lack the gene for inositol phosphate synthase as a result inositol has been considered as an essential nutrient in models of zebrafish metabolism  whereas it is non essential in mammals myo inositol has been identified as a dietary requirement for optimal growth in carp tilapia and parrot fish  although it is worth noting that only the latter species lacks the inositol phosphate synthase gene in the absence of exact measurements of the activity of these various homologues it is worth keeping in mind that optimization of inositol levels may be an important step in developing optimized basal media for fish and that this optimization may need to be performed on a species by species basis amino acid requirements in fish amino acid requirements in terrestrial species were discussed in part a of this series in vivo the same amino acids are essential in most tested fish species  as in humans the exception is arginine which is essential in vivo in fish but only essential in vitro in human cells quantitative dietary amino acid requirements of a number of fish species may serve as useful guides for researchers attempting to optimize cell culture media for particular fish species but it is unclear how direct the translation between quantitative in vivo and in vitro requirements will be amino acid requirements of various mediterranean fish species  and of salmonids  have been reviewed in detail which amino acids if any are required in vitro but not in vivo in fish species is unknown the successful growth of medaka escs in dmem supplemented with only igf  suggests that the in vitro essential amino acids are likely similar between fish and mammals although this leaves room for differences in optimal concentrations amino acid concentration may be an important factor in species specific optimization of media for both embryonic and non embryonic fish cell lines especially in cases where minimizing the cost of media is essential however it may not be necessary in order to achieve the goal of finding a media formulation that works reasonably well for culturing cells from most fish species osmolality teleost fish maintain the osmolality of their extracellular fluids within a fairly narrow range of around mosm kg by actively either taking in for freshwater fish or excreting for marine fish salt  this is close to dmems osmolality of between and mosm kg consistent with this the fish cell culture studies cited above do not deliberately adjust osmolality and media used to culture cells from nile tilapia  which is restricted to fresh or brackish water is of a similar formulation to those used for cells from marine species the exception to this is fish which are osmoconformers meaning that the osmolality of their extracellular fluids matches that of their environment osmoconformers are rare among aquatic vertebrates but include elasmobranchs and hagfish  mesenchymal stem cells from shark embryos were successfully cultured in media with a lower solute concentration in this case expressed as osmolarity than adult cartilaginous fish plasma an observation that may be related to the fact that the fluid within the egg contains a lower solute concentration than the surrounding seawater  culture of cells from osmoconforming species may thus require an explicit consideration of osmolality as it relates to both species and the life stage from which the cell line was derived figure both freshwater a and saltwater b fish actively regulate ion transport in order to achieve the correct osmolality in their tissues wikipedia  media for crustacean cell culture in general the in vivo requirements for most minerals between fish and aquatic crustaceans are fairly similar with some important differences  additionally it may be possible to learn some lessons from insect cell culture due to the close evolutionary relationship between these groups as in vertebrates selenium is thought to be required by shrimp and potentially other crustaceans although a precise value for the requirement has not been reported although evidence for regulated transport and storage of iron has been observed in crustaceans no evidence for iron deficiency in shrimp has been reported this is consistent with the fact that crustaceans primarily rely on the copper containing hemocyanins rather than iron containing hemoglobin for oxygen transport indeed most malacostracans a group that contains both shrimp and crabs lack hemoglobin entirely  consistent with this the dietary copper requirements for shrimp may be between fold and fold higher than those for fish depending on the species  it is unclear whether crustaceans lower iron and higher copper requirements reflect only differences in oxygen transport mechanisms or if requirements of individual cells will also follow the same trend under culture conditions besides iron the only minerals recommended for inclusion in feed formulations for fish but not for shrimp or lobster are iodine and manganese  however these are most likely required only for the proper functioning of particular organs or systems rather than generally required by cells whether fish or land animals and are not included in the standard dmem formulation in summary iron and copper deserve special attention when adapting media formulations from fish to crustaceans because of their vastly different roles in these organisms however oxygen transport the role for which these minerals are best appreciated works very differently in culture compared to in vivo so it is unclear how well whole organism dietary requirements will translate to requirements of single cells many attempts have been made at culturing cells from shrimp with some success yet continuous cell lines have not yet been reported in the academic literature however the wealth of studies performed on primary cells provides some insights into what media formulations show promise  in general it seems that shrimp cells are adaptable to a variety of basal media formulations but which is the most successful seems to be dependent on the cell type in question osmolalities used were higher than that of dmem ranging from to mosm kg fbs has generally been found to support growth of shrimp cells but may not be sufficient for optimal growth various extracts from shrimp or related species are often but not always helpful fbs and chitosan both supported growth of cultures initiated from shrimp embryos and a combination of fgf and igf further stimulated proliferation  an extensive review of cell culture studies in shrimp has been published elsewhere  and includes discussion of both basal media formulations as well as supplements such as fbs and various shrimp extracts despite the challenges reported in establishing shrimp cell lines the shrimp dumplings demonstrated by shiok meats in early point to the feasibility of culturing shrimp cells for the purpose of creating a cultivated food product primary cells from crab hepatopancreas were successfully cultured in x concentrated l buffer reconstituted in artificial seawater  viability of these cells was reduced in the presence of fbs or various crab extracts however these negative effects of fbs are likely cell type dependent rather than species dependent primary crab hemocytes grew well in x concentrated l with amino acid sugar supplement and fbs  similarly x l with fbs was successfully used to grow crab eyestalk neurons whereas fbs was found to be insufficient to support survival  conclusion optimized low cost animal component free media formulations for use with seafood relevant species are desperately needed in order to move cultivated seafood from a promising idea to an economically viable solution to the environmental ethical and food security problems associated with current methods of seafood production fortunately there is a wealth of data on the nutritional needs of seafood species and their biological differences from common terrestrial species raised for meat in addition successful optimization projects for mammalian cells can provide a roadmap for those attempting similar goals in seafood species serum free culture of medaka escs has been demonstrated  although further optimization is needed to reduce costs increase proliferation rates and find formulations adapted to seafood relevant species these studies will take time and effort but there is a clear path ahead towards the optimized media formulations needed to make cultivated seafood a reality the potential effects of media composition on nutritional and organoleptic properties of cultivated seafood products independently of differences in cellular proliferation

Encrypted key signature for all recordings to combat deepfakes and their future impact on society.,9,"Assuming that deepfakes become impossible to distinguish from genuine footage, truth will be at the control of those already in power and democracy will break down. Any transgressions caught on tape can be denied and any opponents can be defamed with fake footage.

To combat this, all recordings on any modern devices could have a ""signature"". This could be encrypted by the private key of the person making the recording (or simply the registered user of the device). 

The signature would be determined by these variables:

- date and time of the recording
- registered user of the device
- the public key of some other entity
- duration of the footage
- some quality of the footage (red/green/blue composition for instance)

What are we hoping to achieve with this protocol?

- Thorough provenance that proves footage was genuinely taken on a given date by a given person and that the content of the video has not been modified. 

Problems:

- Recreating the key and affixing it to doctored footage:

The signature should only be able to be created on the day in question. I know nothing about blockchain but as this provides proof of transaction, perhaps it can be useful here. 

- Screencapture of already doctored footage :

Scenario: a public figure is in a ""compromising"", like a private meeting with few witnesses. The ""Story"" that an offender perpetuates is that this public figure made inappropriate remarks during this meeting, which happened to be caught on tape. The offender therefore simply creates doctored footage/audio before the event, and then on the day of the event, does a screen capture of this footage, thereby generating a valid signature. I have no solutions to this scenario at present.

The Geoengineering Era,9,"The geoengineering age has begun. Australia is now [whitening the clouds](  over the Great Barrier roof to reflect back more of the sun's rays and thereby lower the temperature to prevent bleaching. And if it works there, it'll be used on a massive scale. Here's how I imagine things going

2030: The Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia begin cloud brightening the West Pacific to inhibit hurricane formation and reduce the sweltering heat. It works as intended and by reducing the temperature differential with the East Pacific, it weakens the trade winds, allows warm water to slosh over, and effectively creates a permanent El Nino. Meanwhile, cloud brightening is used to save the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica

2035: The world has now adjusted to the El Nino and learned to enjoy it. Farmers in India now use more efficient irrigation methods and California improved its stormwater drainage systems. Southeast Asia now has a more Mediterranean Climate with cooler temperatures and lower humidity. The Atacama Desert now receives much more rain and temperatures in Canada and the Northwestern United States have increased to make the area more pleasant.  A real estate boom has set off in Idaho's Magic Valley, now much warmer than before. Hurricanes in the Atlantic are less common due to the persistant el nino conditions as are tornadoes. But still, the US begins its own cloud whitening program in the Atlantic to completely eliminate hurricanes. This saves tens of billions of dollars in property damage. The economies of the Caribbean Island take off without hurricanes

2040: The use of laser beams for cloud seeding has been perfected. Using it to break up clouds has provided a major degree of weather control. The Northeast Pacific High is eliminated by breaking up low level clouds and seeding cirrus clouds to allow more heat in. The effect is to make the Western US much wetter. The same is done off the coasts of Chile and Namibia. The gulf of guinea is made cooler while the Mediterranean is made warmer to weaken the Hadley Cell and bring rain to the Sahara. 

2045: California comes to an agreement with Nevada and Arizona to begin seeding clouds on the windward side of the Sierra Nevadas. By breaking up clouds before they can condense, they have a chance of making it to the other side to bring their rain. The great American desert is now green. 

2050: Large scale networks of cloud seeding lasers are able to break up clouds. Winters in the Northern US and Canada are now mild, once-gloomy Northern Europe gets as much sun as Florida.

A theory on religion - Technospiritualism,10,"So I’ve had many disagreements with religion (specifically Christianity) and I don’t know how this popped up into my head but suddenly I had this “what if” idea that changed my view on religion entirely. It is pretty vague, and I understand that there are multiple possibilities that could go along with events in this theory. So it goes along the lines of this:

So before I mention it’s connection to other religions I’d like to explain what the theory is, so bear with me.

Basically, at a simple level, it is the idea that humans that died will be reborn in the future and revived. Yeah, this is pretty vague but I will explain it in better depth. 




A.I. and robots:

So furthermore, I think that with the development of A.I. and robots and technology, science as we know it will increase at an exponential rate. As robots increase themselves, they will have access to better, increased forms of themselves and it will be a continuous cycle. The length at which robots increase themselves and us will stretch forever. And this brings me to my next point


Who will build these robots:

I believe that the richest people (such as Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, etc.) will all succumb to one person who will have a full monopoly over all companies. I will refer to this person that has a monopoly over all industries as “the supreme one” as this will lead to other ideas. I believe that the supreme one will invest into robots early on and eventually become very rich. This person will get genetically and/or physically enhanced by the robots he invested in and will become the most intelligent and wise person on the face of the earth. As his robots and A.I. get exponentially smarter and powerful, so will he. This leads me to my next point, about immortality.


Immortality:

The supreme one and all other humans will become immortal. With the development of artificial organs and physiological development of the bodies, humans will transcend our current states and become immortal. Why? Well because of a lack of knowledge of death and the afterlife. Some will choose to willfully die, while a majority of the population will become immortal. Not only will the living become immortal but so will the dead. How, you ask? I will discuss in one second.


Rise of the Dead:

I believe that in this timeline, the dead will be revived through the use of technology. This is the core belief in this theory, but I believe all dead will be brought back to life by the technology. Technology will have a way to create the exact structures of the human brain through the use of robots and technology together. Humans will be reborn. And also immortal. 


How does this connect to Christianity?: 

Well there are many possibilities in my opinion. One possibility is that Jesus was simply a prophet who conceptualized of the very same thing to the world at the time. The Bible also says that a ruler will promise to give everything to the world, which is in this case immortality. That ruler will be the supreme one. Another thing is that the Bible says that all will be saved and that God will return. Well, I would like to point out that the supreme one will easily be comparable to a god because of how he/she will have developed and enhanced themselves so much. Also, the Bible could have been trying to theorize that the supreme one is the next messiah or God himself. Another theory I have is that, if what the Bible says is true, then Jesus will return to save mankind from the supreme one and his promises and remake Heaven on Earth. 


Overpopulation:

So if this actually happens and everyone is revived from the dead, then there is no doubt that there will be too many humans on the Earth to handle. This overpopulation will be solved by the terraformation of planets through technology and A.I. such as Mars. Also, human space travel will be very common and normal. 



So this idea is only in its infancy and I don’t really have much proof for it, but that’s why I titled it “a theory on religion” and not “the reason why religion exists”. If I missed anything or failed to hold into account an important aspect, please feel free to comment. I’d love to hear feedback about this theory. Any feedback would be nice. I would not recommend showing this to anyone who you think does not have the capability to comprehend this. I also must add that you should take this with a grain of salt because I’m not an expert on theology, religious studies or technology at all by any means.",Futurology,a theory on religion technospiritualism so ive had many disagreements with religion specifically christianity and i dont know how this popped up into my head but suddenly i had this what if idea that changed my view on religion entirely it is pretty vague and i understand that there are multiple possibilities that could go along with events in this theory so it goes along the lines of this so before i mention its connection to other religions id like to explain what the theory is so bear with me basically at a simple level it is the idea that humans that died will be reborn in the future and revived yeah this is pretty vague but i will explain it in better depth  a i and robots so furthermore i think that with the development of a i and robots and technology science as we know it will increase at an exponential rate as robots increase themselves they will have access to better increased forms of themselves and it will be a continuous cycle the length at which robots increase themselves and us will stretch forever and this brings me to my next point who will build these robots i believe that the richest people such as jeff bezos mark zuckerberg elon musk bill gates etc will all succumb to one person who will have a full monopoly over all companies i will refer to this person that has a monopoly over all industries as the supreme one as this will lead to other ideas i believe that the supreme one will invest into robots early on and eventually become very rich this person will get genetically and or physically enhanced by the robots he invested in and will become the most intelligent and wise person on the face of the earth as his robots and a i get exponentially smarter and powerful so will he this leads me to my next point about immortality immortality the supreme one and all other humans will become immortal with the development of artificial organs and physiological development of the bodies humans will transcend our current states and become immortal why well because of a lack of knowledge of death and the afterlife some will choose to willfully die while a majority of the population will become immortal not only will the living become immortal but so will the dead how you ask i will discuss in one second rise of the dead i believe that in this timeline the dead will be revived through the use of technology this is the core belief in this theory but i believe all dead will be brought back to life by the technology technology will have a way to create the exact structures of the human brain through the use of robots and technology together humans will be reborn and also immortal how does this connect to christianity well there are many possibilities in my opinion one possibility is that jesus was simply a prophet who conceptualized of the very same thing to the world at the time the bible also says that a ruler will promise to give everything to the world which is in this case immortality that ruler will be the supreme one another thing is that the bible says that all will be saved and that god will return well i would like to point out that the supreme one will easily be comparable to a god because of how he she will have developed and enhanced themselves so much also the bible could have been trying to theorize that the supreme one is the next messiah or god himself another theory i have is that if what the bible says is true then jesus will return to save mankind from the supreme one and his promises and remake heaven on earth overpopulation so if this actually happens and everyone is revived from the dead then there is no doubt that there will be too many humans on the earth to handle this overpopulation will be solved by the terraformation of planets through technology and a i such as mars also human space travel will be very common and normal so this idea is only in its infancy and i dont really have much proof for it but thats why i titled it a theory on religion and not the reason why religion exists if i missed anything or failed to hold into account an important aspect please feel free to comment id love to hear feedback about this theory any feedback would be nice i would not recommend showing this to anyone who you think does not have the capability to comprehend this i also must add that you should take this with a grain of salt because im not an expert on theology religious studies or technology at all by any means

Caby: A ride hailing company designed for the African Market,2,"[Caby](  was built for the African, and in specific Kenyan market at heart. Many ride hailing companies have come to Kenya, but the problem is they do not change anything on their model to suit the Kenyan market. Instead, they push with what they have. This often results in many conflicts and strikes from the drivers. The complaint is usually one, The Ride hailing companies are taking too much money from them. As a result, we created a new model, a different model, the daily fixed model. With this the drivers don't pay any commission per ride instead they pay a one time off fee and use the app with no additional charge for the next 24 hours. 

You may ask yourself, why not ask for a monthly fee instead. And this is because we understand the Kenyan market. The economy is hand to mouth not many drivers would afford this. So the daily fix works best. But the drivers can still switch to a commission system if they do not like the daily fix. We hand the power back to them.

This also means we can make the fare a little cheaper without hurting the drivers' earnings.

Let's do this practical. A trip costs $10 dollars with many ride hailing companies they would take at least 10% of the trip meaning if the driver takes five trips worth $10 the ride hailing company would take $5. With Caby's daily fix, the driver may pay $2 as the standard fee. What this means even if they take 10 trips worth $10 each we will still take $2. This is why I talked about making trips cheaper without hurting the driver. At the end of the day they still make more money with us, even if the client pays less. This is a business model sculptured for the Kenyan market. 

# Other features that make Caby specific to the Kenyan market are

1. In app payment with Mpesa: A big problem we have had is that drivers often inflate the cab fare by taking screenshots and showing that to you instead of the actual amount. With [Mpesa](  the biggest money transfer option in East africa, you receive a pop up even if your internet is off ensuring that you pay the exact fair.
2. the ride will not start unless you are in the vehicle.

Microsoft Steals Satirical Cryptocurrency,4," 

It has been nearly two years since we published a video for a satirical cryptocurrency that we dubbed 'Wokecoin.'

The concept of Wokecoin is to mine human activity and turn it into tangible value, which is the very concept Microsoft has recently patented, as you can see in this article. [ 

While the concept of Wokecoin is satirical, we sought out to actually launch it as a real cryptocurrency, but never was able to fully go through with this process. We did, however, launch the video explaining the concept, which you can watch here [ 

At the 1:31 mark, we explain the helmet, which is the object that mines human activity -

*""The WokeCoin team is excited to introduce the Halo Technology. This Revolutionary device will merge mindfulness with tangible value. A supporter of WokeCoin simply places the helmet on their head. They then begin meditating. The Halo device then begins to measure the brain wave frequencies of the user. As the user moves into deeper states of meditation, the helmet begins to harvest the mental energy and reward the user with WokeCoin.""*

From there, the video unfolds into more satirical elements, but at this particular point, the main premise is revealed and what Microsoft has likely been influenced by.

The article I posted above quotes the patent and proves this point as well,

*(from the patent) “A brain wave or body heat emitted from the users when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, such as advertisements or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process.”*

*Therefore, the system would be relying more on the user’s actions rather than computation power from the computer. The data, once it meets the set parameters from the cryptosystem, would act as Proof-of-Work, enabling participants to perform mining unconsciously.""*

As the article points out, the users actions could turn into data unconsciously. This is what we were trying to capture in a sort of dystopian, satirical way. But it seems that Microsoft is attempting to do this for real.

So, since hearing about this patent, we have reached out to the inventors listed on the patent on LinkedIn. Their names are Dustin Abramson, Derrick Fu, and Joseph Edwin Johnson JR. We have not yet heard back from them. What's more is we posted on the Microsoft subreddit about the possibility of Microsoft stealing this idea and the post was removed. At this point, we are NOT definitively suggesting that Microsoft stole this from us (despite the clickbaity title), but it seems more than likely that they have been influenced by Wokecoin and may be trying to cover their tracks.",Futurology,microsoft steals satirical cryptocurrency it has been nearly two years since we published a video for a satirical cryptocurrency that we dubbed wokecoin the concept of wokecoin is to mine human activity and turn it into tangible value which is the very concept microsoft has recently patented as you can see in this article while the concept of wokecoin is satirical we sought out to actually launch it as a real cryptocurrency but never was able to fully go through with this process we did however launch the video explaining the concept which you can watch here at the mark we explain the helmet which is the object that mines human activity the wokecoin team is excited to introduce the halo technology this revolutionary device will merge mindfulness with tangible value a supporter of wokecoin simply places the helmet on their head they then begin meditating the halo device then begins to measure the brain wave frequencies of the user as the user moves into deeper states of meditation the helmet begins to harvest the mental energy and reward the user with wokecoin from there the video unfolds into more satirical elements but at this particular point the main premise is revealed and what microsoft has likely been influenced by the article i posted above quotes the patent and proves this point as well from the patent a brain wave or body heat emitted from the users when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider such as advertisements or using certain internet services can be used in the mining process therefore the system would be relying more on the users actions rather than computation power from the computer the data once it meets the set parameters from the cryptosystem would act as proof of work enabling participants to perform mining unconsciously as the article points out the users actions could turn into data unconsciously this is what we were trying to capture in a sort of dystopian satirical way but it seems that microsoft is attempting to do this for real so since hearing about this patent we have reached out to the inventors listed on the patent on linkedin their names are dustin abramson derrick fu and joseph edwin johnson jr we have not yet heard back from them whats more is we posted on the microsoft subreddit about the possibility of microsoft stealing this idea and the post was removed at this point we are not definitively suggesting that microsoft stole this from us despite the clickbaity title but it seems more than likely that they have been influenced by wokecoin and may be trying to cover their tracks

There is a two-way food tray door (sort of like an airlock) that the food service worker puts the food into. Once inside, a powerful UV light shines onto the food for ~10 minutes, thus killing all pathogens. When the food is clean, the door on the patron’s side unlocks, and they can access the food/beverage. At the top of each room would be openings covered in N95 fabric so that the noise and atmosphere of the other patrons in their own rooms can propagate through the restaurant - in order to give it that “Lively” restaurant feel.

What is Crypto Cloud Mining?,3," 

Crypto Cloud Mining is somewhat similar to that of crypto mining with one basic difference. It is a relatively easier ask considering the example of Bitcoin’s mining process. It uses a data center, in a remote location and pooling in the electricity consumed by the processors at associated peripherals. In other words, instead of mining by a particular individual, the process is outsourced or contracted to a third-party, typically an organization who can bear the burden of the cost of electricity and central processing units (CPU), that does all the mining of Bitcoin on behalf of the users without using their own computers. However, if one really wants to protect his savings and investment in fiat currency, the person can opt for Bitcoin mining, instead of being bogged into the cumbersome management of the equipment and associated paraphernalia and in this regard crypto cloud mining is the next best substitute. As this concept provides earning and owning the coins or token you can use the cloud to earn your coins. In essence, the purpose of mining cryptocurrency will be better understood if one quickly breezes through some technological connotations associated with Bitcoin and another cryptocurrency in an oversimplified way, such as hash, the blockchain, Proof of Work (PoW), and Proof of Stake (PoS).

**Importance of Hash Function**

Primarily hash is a mathematical functional tool that assists the miners to translate alphanumeric codes into a heavily encoded random fixed-length number (for security reasons), usually in hexadecimal. For Bitcoin’s blockchain management, creating a hash with the help of an algorithm is vital. Whether it be a single word or a sentence, by using hash the output is in hexadecimal or fixed length, making it very difficult to decipher.

Designing a hash algorithmic function is much need of the day as it empowers the miners to provide secured encryption in crafting a new block. Subsequently, hashing demands exponential CPU output on a mass scale, thus leading to an increase in expenses. Therefore, to lure and encourage both individual miners and mining companies, to incur a substantial amount of capital expenditure with state of the art technology, the organization behind the development of crypto incentivize them. It is done by providing them with the option of (in the shape of coins) a transaction fee denominated in fiat currency. It is vital to mention here that miners are awarded only if the created hash is in congruence with the requirements and criteria, specified in terms and conditions.

Cryptocurrency is expected to take over future modes of payments more specifically because of the blockchain technology.

三的诗,2,"三的诗

&amp;#x200B;

当一个刚识数的小孩数着一二三，于是便产生了一首诗。

我不是诗人，当然不会写诗，可是我至今也弄不明白：

为什么这个世界只有三才“天地人”？为什么他们才是万物之始？不是说一生二、二生三、三生万物吗？只有三，才有增加、发展之意？

我们祖国历来源远，为什么只有三皇呢？燧人钻火，而火象征太阳，是谓天皇；伏羲游凡，是谓人皇；而神农垦地，是谓地皇。还有一皇吗？没有。为什么？不知道。

为什么人们象往的只有三光“日月星”，只有它们才能给人们光明、希望和不灭的热情。为什么历史上只有三代“夏商周”，它们才有权利代表我国的奴隶文明？

我们祖国历来是礼义之邦，可这与三有什么关系，偏留下那么多三的典故。桓公三畔三浴迎管仲，重耳三退三舍报成王。玄德公不也是三顾三迎而起卧龙的吗？古人为什么要三让？鞠躬为什么要三次才表示真正的尊敬？敲门为什么要三下才能得到主人应允？就是古人行刑前追魂炮，也要三响呢？

人们都说事不过三，可是这又为什么？祝家庄非三打不破，高太尉非三败不归。为什么三国非三国不鼎？周公瑾也要三气方死吗？

为什么？我闹不明白。

前几年，不到处见三个字在墙上、工厂牌上吗？它们是人们早熟了的“工农兵”，只有他们才能代表我们国家的人民。

国家领导人为什么提出要把三大球搞上去，而体坛上球赛很多。

当人们使劲时，不是数着一二三，于是一件事便完成，为什么不再数个四呢？

为什么有了左中右、上中下、前中后呢？

真闹不明白。

噢，原来三是万物之始，是一首真正的诗。",Futurology,  amp x b

AI Pace of Future Progress: Why 'experts' don't know what they think they know.,5,"I am very wary of this idea I keep hearing that we won't create AGI anytime soonish (i.e. for decades or centuries) and don't need to worry about its dangers too much because:

""W*e can't even agree on what general intelligence""* or because ""*we don't know what consciousness is"",* or because ""*our current AGI underperforms at tasks a one-year-old can master""* or because *""we don't know how organic brains work yet"".* 

**SO WHAT.** 

*~~Many~~* *most great discoveries came from* **accidents or hunches***.*

We don't need to achieve any scientific consensus about anything for an AGI breakthrough to occur.  We don't need to know how consciousness is generated in the human brain to stumble on a way to create it by accident or hunch. We **CAN'T** estimate how many breakthroughs will be needed precisely because we don't have the information to estimate that. 

We might be one breakthrough away from success and/or calamity.  Experts tend to think of progress as an incremental process because that's how it goes for most of them personally throughout their careers. Most will never make a huge discovery that pushes a field forward enormously (or creates a new field) almost overnight. But such big discoveries disproportionally affect history. Incremental technological and scientific progress is just the lulls between these sudden storms, were so much progress is made rapidly.

In conclusion, I think we don't really know it isn't **TO LATE** to start worrying about the so-called 'AI Control Problem'.

Cryptocurrency and Corruption – Can Crypto Help Fight It?,6," 

Technological advances have helped every sector in the world in numerous ways. These sectors range from sports to healthcare and transportation. Technology has provided means to bring down levels of fraud and has dramatically increased accountability at all levels. This holds true for the public sector more than anywhere else. For instance, if the government starts an infrastructure project such as a road or a bridge, it can easily track where each cent is being used, identify all parties who are using the funds and can easily ensure only authorized people are accessing it only on expenses that were pre-agreed.

Tech has greatly reduced both the time and money spent on investigation of frauds. Financial tracking can help reduce bribes in the public sector which amounts to around $2 trillion, which is roughly 2 percent of the global GDP. The better the financial tracking systems are, the better will be the chances for increased economic development.

Cryptocurrency uses cryptography to ensure the security of transactions by identifying the users of the currency in each transaction unlike traditional modes of payments like currency notes and coins. Even though most cryptocurrencies are anonymous and it is not possible to identify the user; we have a few examples and it is technologically possible to add an ID number making the crypto non-anonymous. 

Governments can use the block chain technology to their advantage to not only facilitate payments but also keep them clean and secure. Crypto are a much more efficient mode of payment than other existing modes, and with the launch of the Bytus wallet, a blockchain-based ecosystem which allows for the conversion of crypto into fiat, it has become even more reliable and efficient. Government can have a digital currency designed for use in their projects and have specific IDs added to them so that they can keep track of each transaction. The value of this cryptocurrency can be determined by the market or can be pegged to a physical currency to reduce its price volatility.

A blockchain is effectively a growing list of transactions that are recorded in a chronological order. It cannot be deleted or modified retroactively which allows for transparency that can help against corruption of all kinds. If every user in the blockchain has an ID it would mean every transaction can be traced back to a single person. This lack of anonymity and tight traceability can help eradicate corruption and bribery.

It is safe to assume that crypto can not only facilitate payments but also it can prove to be a helpful means in reducing fraud and corruption on a global level. It can reduce the cost of enforcement and because of the readily available information regarding the transactions, the efficiency and effectiveness of the spending can be measured.",Futurology,cryptocurrency and corruption can crypto help fight it technological advances have helped every sector in the world in numerous ways these sectors range from sports to healthcare and transportation technology has provided means to bring down levels of fraud and has dramatically increased accountability at all levels this holds true for the public sector more than anywhere else for instance if the government starts an infrastructure project such as a road or a bridge it can easily track where each cent is being used identify all parties who are using the funds and can easily ensure only authorized people are accessing it only on expenses that were pre agreed tech has greatly reduced both the time and money spent on investigation of frauds financial tracking can help reduce bribes in the public sector which amounts to around trillion which is roughly percent of the global gdp the better the financial tracking systems are the better will be the chances for increased economic development cryptocurrency uses cryptography to ensure the security of transactions by identifying the users of the currency in each transaction unlike traditional modes of payments like currency notes and coins even though most cryptocurrencies are anonymous and it is not possible to identify the user we have a few examples and it is technologically possible to add an id number making the crypto non anonymous governments can use the block chain technology to their advantage to not only facilitate payments but also keep them clean and secure crypto are a much more efficient mode of payment than other existing modes and with the launch of the bytus wallet a blockchain based ecosystem which allows for the conversion of crypto into fiat it has become even more reliable and efficient government can have a digital currency designed for use in their projects and have specific ids added to them so that they can keep track of each transaction the value of this cryptocurrency can be determined by the market or can be pegged to a physical currency to reduce its price volatility a blockchain is effectively a growing list of transactions that are recorded in a chronological order it cannot be deleted or modified retroactively which allows for transparency that can help against corruption of all kinds if every user in the blockchain has an id it would mean every transaction can be traced back to a single person this lack of anonymity and tight traceability can help eradicate corruption and bribery it is safe to assume that crypto can not only facilitate payments but also it can prove to be a helpful means in reducing fraud and corruption on a global level it can reduce the cost of enforcement and because of the readily available information regarding the transactions the efficiency and effectiveness of the spending can be measured

For Earth Day: A Proposal to Create a Multi-Tiered Think Tank to Crowdsource Innovations to Alter the Future of the Climate Crisis,2,"Thinkstep (working name) is a novel think-tank model that will use a multi-tier validation process to separate valuable ideas from noise, allowing only the best ideas to percolate from the bottom to the top tier, to be populated by leading authorities in every academic discipline. Such a structure would allow innovative thinkers from around the world, from any socioeconomic background, the ability to have their ideas considered by leading experts in a given academic field, while eliminating noise for users in the top tier.

- Thinkstep will launch with a singular focus: inviting leaders in the field of climate science to populate the top tiers within climate science and geoengineering. 
- Upon registration, each top-tier user will be asked to invite two to three of their most esteemed colleagues to populate the climate science sub. 
- To stimulate original content, each new user will also be asked to post either a link to an article or paper relevant to their field, or to post an idea or problem facing their field.
- Each tier 1 member will be given two or four invites for their top graduate students to populate tier 2, and an open invitation/link for all of their students to populate tier 4.
- Other academic disciplines will be added after climate science hub becomes established and tested.
- Site be visually similar to Reddit, as it will be based on Reddit's legacy code, but will incorporate tier and keyword features of StackExchange
- Will allow members from tier 1-8 to post research articles, news, and ideas which will percolate upward as they gain more votes from higher tiers. 
- Ultimate goal is to create the rules and infrastructure to become world's first DAO cross-disciplinary think tank.
- For the sake of avoiding attacks, politics/activism will be strictly  forbidden. The goal is to focus on creating solutions to climate change without inviting backlash.

Conversation about the future of humanity,4," There are two types of people in this world. People who see problems, and people who choose to try and fix them. How many of us walk past trash that is in our direct path, but instead of picking it up, just assume that someone else will. “Not my circus, not my monkeys.” I put my decade into retail, and I first heard some of this philosophy in sales training. It made sense then and it makes sense now, but back then it was being used in the worst way. All the management pyramid above me cared about was pulling levers to make sure we made more profit then last year. I’m sure I am not alone in witnessing reorganization every 2 to 3 years, but the end results were always focused on cutting out the human “waste” and maximizing what could be done with less people for the same hourly wages. I mean this in the nicest way, but fuck that operating model. We, the people who made our CEO’s millions, deserve the praise and appropriate compensation for busting our asses 40 to 80 hours a week, so that they could go play golf and write it off as a business meeting.

I chose a few years back to convert my time to fixing the problems that I care most about, instead of helping build up the people who treat 80% of us as an expendable resource. I may still only be a small grain of sand in this time and place in our universe, but I will no longer let myself be willfully ignorant as to what I am contributing my effort into building. That being said, I am going to keep sharing and allow myself to be vulnerable in sharing my vision for the future. People can take it or leave it. The trolls will continue to have their fun, but they usually end up helping me in my effort to be an optimistic stoic, and I take pity on the lives that had to be experienced to make trolls find joy in others misery.. Pessimists (realists, if you prefer), what parts of the world around you make you lose faith in humanity, and why does it have to be that way, just because that’s the way it has always been?

Through this post, I am not looking for investors or buyers, or a pat on the back. I want discussion and change. I have worked on this daily for nearly 3 years, and have shared with friends and family to fine tune over the last year or so. Now it is time to get thoughts from outside my own little bubble. I have posted parts of this before, and get a little conversation here and there. Today I am posting more technical “how” instead of the “what”, but feel free to look up previous posts for more info. If I get no traction today, I can guarantee I will edit some more and try again in the near future. Humanity is on the brink of greatness, and all we need to do is shift our mindset for what we use all of our hard work to accomplish.

If this is inappropriate for this sub, I apologize for not conveying this in a way that matters to you, but I argue that the underlying ideas can be converted into anything you put your mind to.

1. Find houses that are falling behind on repair and maintenance.  

   1. Bike and walk dogs through the current neighborhood.
   2. Recently widowed homeowners are a good candidate.
   3. Find a small amount of time to donate to helping neighbors do easy projects.  

      1. Use this time as an opportunity to learn what they need, what support they have, long term goals, etc.
      2. Create community events to take care of the properties that are farthest behind.
   4. Create an actual govt program to be more productive with govt owned properties.  

      1. Instead of selling the property to an investor, fix the property with the specific intent of providing housing for some form of underserved population.
      2. This is the reasoning behind structuring as a non-profit.
      3. If created correctly might be a great way to scale by using other “flippers” as partners. Maybe have some sort of special qualification to show that all of their properties meet or exceed a specific checklist of predetermined updates to the property.
2. “Buy” the property from the homeowner at current market price, but let them continue to live there and offer continued support to get the house up to common standards, and keep it that way.  

   1. Establish minimum standards referencing those used to obtain FHA lending.
   2. Probably worth a professional home inspection if it has been more than 6 years since the last.  

      1. Build a step by step scope of work and schedule that brings the house up to common standards.
      2. Schedule “check-up” walk throughs after year 1, year 3, and every 3 years after that.
   3. Ideally the resident of the property will carry the note, or a combination of a smaller loan from a bank to cover a chunk of cash if needed.  

      1. Establish the purchase price at the beginning of the relationship based on current market value. Allow portions of the renovation expenses to be paid for by the GNA in exchange for a principal payment towards the purchase of the home. ([Current Trial]( 
      2. The resident holds the note with no interest until they are ready to move.
      3. Once equity hits 30%, offer to get investor financing to get a lump sum payment, and revert to renting for the cost of operation.
   4. Create a crowdfunded[ investment portfolio](  to fund the different stages of the process.  

      1. Allow any dollar amount to be invested. Market towards the best mix of smart investing, and providing humanitarian services for the communities we live in.
      2. Match or beat 1 year CD returns for a bank. Look into options to rollover into amortized payback or growth.
      3. Offer long term retirement funds that look similar to mortgage amortization schedules.
      4. Explore options to donate portions of the interest gained to provide community support to help rehab homes with people who need help, but can’t afford it.
      5. Create regularly updated, highly visual progress reports for the various remodel/ renovation projects. This would be a great marketing tool to make this investing option more appealing than traditional investing. It would be cool to mount project cameras that create a time lapse of each process. Bonus if it can be turned into an educational how-to guide.
3. The resident can either pay out of pocket for any work needing to be done, or they can let the GNA cover it in exchange for direct principal payments off the original market price purchase.  

   1. Make a [simple guide](  to what needs to be done on a regular basis, and establish a plan for what the resident can handle, vs what the [GNA provides]( 
   2. Create synergy with kids and grandkids to accomplish common/ regular tasks.  

      1. Opportunity for daycare/ day camp, or even homeschool type services.
      2. Opportunity for future continued business partners to take over living on the residence.
   3. Preferred scenario, resident pays for material and professional labor, and the GNA provides cheaper labor for easy tasks etc.  

      1. Residents may pay part of the labor cost, but ideally if the GNA has cash to pay internal employees, then those costs get applied as principal payments.
      2. Explore options that let GNA employees trade time for ownership of that specific property, instead of traditional pay, or use it as an overtime bonus.
   4. Find ways to incorporate local artists and craftsmen, and make unique projects that incorporate the story of the house as told by the resident. Every resident should leave behind part of their story and history.  

      1. Add an inspiration page to the website.
      2. Would even be fun to do DIY projects with the resident directly.
4. Offer additional services as needed, including healthcare support, social support, general errands etc.  

   1. Leverage nursing friends to create a home health care wing of the company.
   2. Explore research on the use of therapy animals, and incorporate into services.
   3. Create events that promote group interactions across the various tenants within the GNA community.  

      1. Team sports
      2. Regular cookouts
      3. Team building
   4. Find ways to focus on any positive impacts for children in the home.  

      1. Look into unique tutoring or home schooling business ventures.
      2. Provide ride services to ensure kids get to school.
      3. Offer daycare services.
      4. Create a unique fund matching opportunity to promote investment in an early fund for either graduation or retirement.
5. When a resident is ready to move, offer support in other available properties within the GNA, or moving services to their desired location.  

   1. Build a department to assist in everything moving related, including processing procedures for personal belongings that may not fit in the new location.
   2. Explore the idea of a “Brick and Mortar” operation to deal with accumulation of household items that is an inevitable part of the entire process. Try to avoid throwing everything away.
6. The resident can collect monthly payments until the property is purchased in full by the GNA, or can cash out and a traditional loan will be sought for GNA to finish the purchase.  

   1. If there is an “owner carry” deal currently established, then subtract the remaining rehab costs as a principal payment.
   2. If the GNA is simply purchasing the property, then it needs to fall into “70% rule”.  

      1. Purchase price = 70%ARV - Est rehab
      2. This option typically leaves less money for the original homeowner, when compared to the “owner carry” structure.
   3. Allow for equity transfer to other properties in the GNA portfolio.  

      1. This option might allow for the lowest cost to process everything,
7. Bring every aspect of the property up to common standards.  

   1. “If you are going to do it, do it right.”
   2. Be creative and conscious of everything that is salvageable.  

      1. Refinish and sell/ donate old fixtures.
      2. Repair over replace if possible. Keep tabs on new age techniques (resin, etc.)
8. Hire a live in manager resident that will gain ownership of the property through proper management and monthly dues that cover repair budgets, taxes, insurance, amortized purchase of the property, and management support from the GNA.  

   1. GNA marketing: Looking for an apprentice steward for this property, and a partner in the long term equity to be gained from the property. In exchange it is possible to get a reduction in rent for those who are able to effectively self manage the property, as well as additional opportunities to make hourly wages as high as $21 an hour. I want someone who is interested in developing themselves as well as the property and I want to provide all the tools necessary to enhance the ability of the steward to start their own business.
   2. (Alternate) -Good Neighbor University: Use all of the accumulated knowledge, guides, and trackers to teach new highschool graduates how to renovate and maintain a home, how to manage the entire accounting process (both personally and the business of their property). They can still complete all the general education classes at a local community college. The GNA will provide a property to be used as their housing, and as a job. The scope of work can be full renovation of their own property, management of their property, and additional work across the GNA. Their monthly housing dues will cover the operating costs and create a repair budget to help them appropriately manage their property. In exchange they will gain partnered ownership (equity) in the property. Pay scale will follow the $12, $15, $18 per hour scale described elsewhere in the plan.  

      1. Additionally might be able to offer employee benefits including healthcare, retirement support, and technical training.
      2. Target market might be easier to access by creating a “[Flip to Own](  process. Might also be wise to target the younger generation before they get too far into a career or college path.
   3. Household income must be 3 times the “Monthly Operation Payment”.  

      1. Create unique opportunities to create income from excess space in a property (vacation/air bnb, temp housing for travel nurse, students, etc.)
      2. Residents may choose to use roommates to meet this requirement.
   4. Pet owners buy all the flooring instead of a pet deposit. If they don’t need replaced, might offer to dump it back into the built up repair fund on moving out.
   5. Instead of a traditional deposit, the new resident can spend up to .1% market value on initial property upgrades, finishes, etc. This is applied as a direct principal payment.  

      1. Good test to see how easy they are to work with on household projects.
      2. This gets an early vested interest in the property, which is the primary principal of this plan.
   6. Require reading “7 Habits of Highly Effective People”  

      1. Must create a habit of reading for 15 minutes every day until the book is done.
      2. This helps lay groundwork to understand much of the management process expected. Many of the guides follow these principles, and the new resident will be required to complete several activities derived from the book.
   7. Legal structure will likely mirror that of a “Rent to Own” plan.  

      1. Create legal contract that establishes the tenant purchasing the property from the GNA at the current market price. The GNA will carry the note and establish unique guidelines that dictate the “Monthly Operating Payment”, and the procedures when the tenant wishes to move out of the property. This will also spell out all the rules and regulations to continue to qualify/ avoid eviction.
      2. Instead of using fear of eviction as a means to keep tenants in line, create a cultural shift to address underlying problems instead. We don’t need to help people dig a deeper hole when they are already in trouble. We should instead work together to build a solution that ensures the moral support needed to get to a better place in life.I think the way the whole organization is structured will also provide another sense of accountability towards each other.
      3. Create a “Flip to Own” plan that lets future tenants be more involved with the initial renovation between occupants.
   8. Create a transparent “[Monthly Operation Payment](  that includes:  

      1. An investment buy in (market value amortized over 30 years @ current market rate + .3%).
      2. Taxes &amp; insurance (will also need renters insurance).
      3. Utilities (goal is to have a history of avgs, but will be paid as billed).
      4. Any cost associated with labor support for “[Property Stewardship Guide](  (basic cleaning and lawn care).
      5. Repairs and Maintenance budget (.1% market value, any expense related to maintaining current market value/ rent ready condition).
      6. [Capital Expenditures](  Major repair budget (.1% market value, any expense related to increasing market value and capital expenditures).
      7. Good neighbor assistance dues (.1% market value, covers accounting costs and assistance access).
   9. Create an [app](  that makes monthly property management an easy habit.  

      1. Pull information from [Property Stewardship Guide]( 
      2. It keeps [track ](  all the costs that determine the monthly payment, including utilities.
      3. It has a checklist of that months maintenance tasks, based on the standards of the GNA, that ensures the most effective life of the property.
      4. Have a portal to submit rent payments, using paypal or similar services.
      5. Build in an option to apply employee wages from the GNA as rent payments.
      6. Have a profile page with all the important dates and documents.
   10. Leverage these managing residents to build a [coalition of labor support](  for the rest of the properties under the GNA umbrella.
   11. If they are all employees of the GNA non profit, then we can distribute benefits including healthcare, retirement savings, etc.
   12. Create a rolling pay scale:
   13. Offer work in exchange for equity ownership in other projects.
9. When the current managing resident is ready to move, they can either cash out remaining repair budgets and equity, or leave their equity in and share the profits with GNA equal to their equity share.  

   1. The managing resident will partner in the process of getting the house back to full market standards.  

      1. Use the stockpiled [repair budgets](  to fix their respective categories.
      2. Use built up equity if repair budgets don’t cover that cost.
      3. The remaining repair budgets will be applied as a direct principal payment.
   2. If the managing resident wants to [cash out](  then the GNA will buy back the property at the current market price.  

      1. Both parties will pay their traditional closing costs if applicable.
   3. If the managing resident wants to remain an equity partner, then the title is changed to reflect that business relationship, and the managing resident receives monthly payments [equal to their share](  of rental profits or interest payments of the next resident.  

      1. Previous managing residents must create and manage their own LLC.
      2. If the previous resident has more than 50% ownership in the property, then they are in charge of managing the property.
      3. The [monthly payment](  for the previous residents equity will be equal to their percentage of ownership times either the interest earned from the next resident’s purchase, or from the profits if it is run as a traditional rental.",Futurology,conversation about the future of humanity there are two types of people in this world people who see problems and people who choose to try and fix them how

several activities derived from the book  legal structure will likely mirror that of a rent to own plan   create legal contract that establishes the tenant purchasing the property from the gna at the current market price the gna will carry the note and establish unique guidelines that dictate the monthly operating payment and the procedures when the tenant wishes to move out of the property this will also spell out all the rules and regulations to continue to qualify avoid eviction  instead of using fear of eviction as a means to keep tenants in line create a cultural shift to address underlying problems instead we dont need to help people dig a deeper hole when they are already in trouble we should instead work together to build a solution that ensures the moral support needed to get to a better place in life i think the way the whole organization is structured will also provide another sense of accountability towards each other  create a flip to own plan that lets future tenants be more involved with the initial renovation between occupants  create a transparent monthly operation payment that includes   an investment buy in market value amortized over years current market rate   taxes amp insurance will also need renters insurance  utilities goal is to have a history of avgs but will be paid as billed  any cost associated with labor support for property stewardship guide basic cleaning and lawn care  repairs and maintenance budget market value any expense related to maintaining current market value rent ready condition   capital expenditures major repair budget market value any expense related to increasing market value and capital expenditures  good neighbor assistance dues market value covers accounting costs and assistance access  create an app that makes monthly property management an easy habit   pull information from property stewardship guide   it keeps track all the costs that determine the monthly payment including utilities  it has a checklist of that months maintenance tasks based on the standards of the gna that ensures the most effective life of the property  have a portal to submit rent payments using paypal or similar services  build in an option to apply employee wages from the gna as rent payments  have a profile page with all the important dates and documents  leverage these managing residents to build a coalition of labor support for the rest of the properties under the gna umbrella  if they are all employees of the gna non profit then we can distribute benefits including healthcare retirement savings etc  create a rolling pay scale  offer work in exchange for equity ownership in other projects when the current managing resident is ready to move they can either cash out remaining repair budgets and equity or leave their equity in and share the profits with gna equal to their equity share  the managing resident will partner in the process of getting the house back to full market standards   use the stockpiled repair budgets to fix their respective categories  use built up equity if repair budgets dont cover that cost  the remaining repair budgets will be applied as a direct principal payment  if the managing resident wants to cash out then the gna will buy back the property at the current market price   both parties will pay their traditional closing costs if applicable  if the managing resident wants to remain an equity partner then the title is changed to reflect that business relationship and the managing resident receives monthly payments equal to their share of rental profits or interest payments of the next resident   previous managing residents must create and manage their own llc  if the previous resident has more than ownership in the property then they are in charge of managing the property  the monthly payment for the previous residents equity will be equal to their percentage of ownership times either the interest earned from the next residents purchase or from the profits if it is run as a traditional rental

“Punch Card” DNA Could Mean Cheaper High-Capacity Data Storage,4, ,Futurology, punch card dna could mean cheaper high capacity data storage 
Biometrics in the airport setting,4,"So I’m going to start this story out with a little bit of background... I am a 22 year old female interior designer working as a designer in my company’s aviation studio. We do all kinds of projects from competitions for uber elevate, terminal renovation, and designing flight information kiosks using leading edge technology. I have a really good rapport with the company and the path I’m going in is towards technology and research applied to design.

With COVID19 making such an impact on the aviation industry, my studio is in talks about how design will be affected by the paradigm shift we are seeing. The guy leading the COVID19 adapt effort wants me on this effort, but my views on biometrics in the aviation environment isn’t too positive. With that being said- I want to take my points to this reddit thread and see if anyone has insight on this topic as my background is in design. The main topic is touchless processing, and biometrics is a huge part of this conversation.

My concern is that once the US signs onto biometrics in aviation we are opening up a Pandora’s box to a big brother reality...but we are presenting the technology as secure and safe to our clients.

The guy leading this effort responded to an email I sent with an initial inquiry about where the company stands on such a politically and ethically charged issue, and copied in the other three middle aged white men (they’re cool but def all from the same demographic). Their point is that with things like Clear and Global Entry, there are so many individuals who are willing to give up their data in the name of public health.

My thoughts: is this the same public that indulges is corroding their dopamine receptors through social media?  The same public that got behind the patriot act and forfeited civil liberties like it was nothing in the name of stopping terrorism?

Am I going too much against the grain for what is happening here? 

Russia and Moldova are already using biometrics to fine quarantine violators. This seems like a choice time to scale biometrics and with the mass of people being trusting in the government I think the use of biometrics can be grossly misapplied. At the same time I can see that the trend is going that way. I have no clue what my role is in this debate yet, but I don’t see others jumping at the red flags this application has",Futurology,biometrics in the airport setting so im going to start this story out with a little bit of background i am a year old female interior designer working as a designer in my companys aviation studio we do all kinds of projects from competitions for uber elevate terminal renovation and designing flight information kiosks using leading edge technology i have a really good rapport with the company and the path im going in is towards technology and research applied to design with covid making such an impact on the aviation industry my studio is in talks about how design will be affected by the paradigm shift we are seeing the guy leading the covid adapt effort wants me on this effort but my views on biometrics in the aviation environment isnt too positive with that being said i want to take my points to this reddit thread and see if anyone has insight on this topic as my background is in design the main topic is touchless processing and biometrics is a huge part of this conversation my concern is that once the us signs onto biometrics in aviation we are opening up a pandoras box to a big brother reality but we are presenting the technology as secure and safe to our clients the guy leading this effort responded to an email i sent with an initial inquiry about where the company stands on such a politically and ethically charged issue and copied in the other three middle aged white men theyre cool but def all from the same demographic their point is that with things like clear and global entry there are so many individuals who are willing to give up their data in the name of public health my thoughts is this the same public that indulges is corroding their dopamine receptors through social media the same public that got behind the patriot act and forfeited civil liberties like it was nothing in the name of stopping terrorism am i going too much against the grain for what is happening here russia and moldova are already using biometrics to fine quarantine violators this seems like a choice time to scale biometrics and with the mass of people being trusting in the government i think the use of biometrics can be grossly misapplied at the same time i can see that the trend is going that way i have no clue what my role is in this debate yet but i dont see others jumping at the red flags this application has

Blockchain and the Future of Online Payments,4," 

Cryptocurrency has been subject to a lot of raised eyebrows recently because of the crises that these currencies are recently facing. The critics of cryptocurrency now feel that they were correct in doubting its credibility and application as a mode of payment. This might have been the case if the blockchain technology would not have advanced to the point where its applications are now seemingly endless. The application of blockchain is now considered to be realistic in sectors varying from construction to politics.

The recent plunge in the cryptocurrency market has seen a trend towards recovery with a market cap of approximately $180 billion. It owes this movement towards a prospective recovery to the advancements in blockchain technology. The market is fairly optimistic about blockchain, and this has led to the development of a sense of trust in cryptocurrencies as well. Companies like Global Digital Payment, led by founder and blockchain developer are fully aware of the applications of blockchain and have thus launched on a blockchain based ecosystem that will help both buyers and sellers in regulating and standardizing payments in cryptocurrency. Users will be able to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat money without paying any sort of transaction charges. This venture will be performed by Global Digital Payment’s wholly owned subsidiary [Bytus]( 

Cryptocurrency is still in more of an embryonic stage to be adapted as a major mode of online payments. As of now, there are various other means that have been dominant. Like in China, WeChat and AliPay have been the most used means of payment. Combined with QR readers and NFC these modes have taken over not only cash but also cards. Cash has slowly been phasing out as a means of payment, especially in the developed nations. It is very soon that we will witness cashless economic systems running in their full flow.

All we know right now is that blockchain technology is the future in almost every sector in the world. This technology gained its popularity through the advent of cryptocurrency, and it is only a matter of time when we see people adapting cryptocurrency to carry out their transactions. Security of payments is one of the many aspects that blockchain brings into play and with these advancements we see the possibilities are virtually endless.

As of now, the main problem that exists with crypto is that it is not a widely accepted means of payment and that it cannot be readily converted into cash. Bytus’ ecosystem has solved the latter of the two main problems, as you can convert your cryptocurrencies into fiat money. The problem that remains now is just a matter of trust that will increase as time passes on. It is safe to say that crypto is a bit ahead of its time, and we can expect the age of cryptocurrency to arrive soon with breakthroughs in blockchain acting as the main catalyst in speeding this process.",Futurology,blockchain and the future of online payments cryptocurrency has been subject to a lot of raised eyebrows recently because of the crises that these currencies are recently facing the critics of cryptocurrency now feel that they were correct in doubting its credibility and application as a mode of payment this might have been the case if the blockchain technology would not have advanced to the point where its applications are now seemingly endless the application of blockchain is now considered to be realistic in sectors varying from construction to politics the recent plunge in the cryptocurrency market has seen a trend towards recovery with a market cap of approximately billion it owes this movement towards a prospective recovery to the advancements in blockchain technology the market is fairly optimistic about blockchain and this has led to the development of a sense of trust in cryptocurrencies as well companies like global digital payment led by founder and blockchain developer are fully aware of the applications of blockchain and have thus launched on a blockchain based ecosystem that will help both buyers and sellers in regulating and standardizing payments in cryptocurrency users will be able to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat money without paying any sort of transaction charges this venture will be performed by global digital payments wholly owned subsidiary bytus cryptocurrency is still in more of an embryonic stage to be adapted as a major mode of online payments as of now there are various other means that have been dominant like in china wechat and alipay have been the most used means of payment combined with qr readers and nfc these modes have taken over not only cash but also cards cash has slowly been phasing out as a means of payment especially in the developed nations it is very soon that we will witness cashless economic systems running in their full flow all we know right now is that blockchain technology is the future in almost every sector in the world this technology gained its popularity through the advent of cryptocurrency and it is only a matter of time when we see people adapting cryptocurrency to carry out their transactions security of payments is one of the many aspects that blockchain brings into play and with these advancements we see the possibilities are virtually endless as of now the main problem that exists with crypto is that it is not a widely accepted means of payment and that it cannot be readily converted into cash bytus ecosystem has solved the latter of the two main problems as you can convert your cryptocurrencies into fiat money the problem that remains now is just a matter of trust that will increase as time passes on it is safe to say that crypto is a bit ahead of its time and we can expect the age of cryptocurrency to arrive soon with breakthroughs in blockchain acting as the main catalyst in speeding this process

Can Mars colonization first steps (or the majority of them) be made entirely by intelligent robots?,1," In the past, we dreamed a lot about going to Mars in the 2020s or 2030s, but a lot of people today say that it isn't the time yet, by the way, we didn't even go to the moon since 1976. The evolution of artificial intelligence in the last two decades was absurd, we went to rudimentary robots to robots that can understand its surroundings and adapt to it, like the [Atlas](  so if the first trip to Mars happen in 2040-2070, imagine how artificial intelligence and robots will have improved by then, and why don't use them first instead of humans?

Imagine a robot that can handle objects exactly like humans do, but it do not need food, water, oxygen and do not get affected by the radiation, pressure, extremely low temperatures and dust. It could stay there for dozens of years and ""pave the ground"" for humans, make objects and devices with advanced 3D printers and Mars [ores](  the first martian base, start the environment for future plantations and even extract water to stock it, resulting in a much safer trip for the first humans to go there. The comunication between Earth and Mars probably will still be limited to small things, like images and texts, but it would be enough due to the adaptability and intelligence of these Robots, they would know their purpouse and even how to fix each other.

This program went by many different names but many people refer to it as ""World One"", and it was a pretty big deal for its time. They determined that the current state of pollution throughout the world wouldn't be able to sustain itself for more than a couple more decades. 

The reason I bring this up is that they predicted that the slow demise of the world would begin in 2020, which would kick off in that year with several catastrophic events. This demise would eventually climax in 2040, in which the end of civilization as we know it would come. Now, I'd just like to mention that this is all based on 1970's statistics and was mostly used as a way to warn governments to cut down on their natural resource usage. But, with the Doomsday clock just 100 seconds away from midnight, and the whole Australia wildfires and Coronavirus stuff, did they have a point? Are we just a few decades away from a completely changed world?

The Future of AI and Automation on Human Work,8,"Hi Everyone,

I have been doing some research into the future of human work, as a result of AI and automation.  Here are my thoughts... 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming ever more pervasive in the organisation and management of everyday life. Oxford Economics (2019) estimates that 20 million UK workers will lose their jobs by 2030 to AI and automation, while McKinsey (2017) predicts the obsolescence of 800 million workers globally. New job positions are emerging: roles rooted in creativity and interpersonal interaction.

Those seeking employment face unprecedented challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified international response to widespread economic disruption experienced by individuals and organisations. The nature of work globally is changing; transferable skills are accepted as essential for prosperity.

I would very much like your thoughts on how this will impact how we educate, train and demonstrate skillsets to maximise employment opportunities, in the hope we can better prepare for the digital age.

I would be keen to get a discussion going!",Futurology,the future of ai and automation on human work hi everyone i have been doing some research into the future of human work as a result of ai and automation here are my thoughts artificial intelligence ai is becoming ever more pervasive in the organisation and management of everyday life oxford economics  estimates that million uk workers will lose their jobs by to ai and automation while mckinsey  predicts the obsolescence of million workers globally new job positions are emerging roles rooted in creativity and interpersonal interaction those seeking employment face unprecedented challenges the covid pandemic has amplified international response to widespread economic disruption experienced by individuals and organisations the nature of work globally is changing transferable skills are accepted as essential for prosperity i would very much like your thoughts on how this will impact how we educate train and demonstrate skillsets to maximise employment opportunities in the hope we can better prepare for the digital age i would be keen to get a discussion going

Jumping ahead, for Earth to be one unified government, all pre-existing countries would have to have the same idea for a system of government.

I am a part of a team based in The Netherlands that has personal self driving robots (PSDR). The robots will be able to carry about 10kgs worth of groceries or medicine and deliver it. 

We came up with the idea to deliver supplies and medicine to people who are vulnerable to COVID-19 for EVERYONE, not only the big corporations. The goal is to reduce the spread, but also making sure everyone still manages to get the supplies they need for daily consumption.

This is how it works:

1. We will provide the software for FREE (for personal use only). The software is based on deep learning for autonomous driving. 
2. We will provide you a FREE extended guide on how to build the robot yourself. 
3. You will order the parts (local) and build the robot. (Everybody can do it)

Do you know any friends or family who might be interested in building this Personal Self-Driving Robot?

Please comment below or email: psdr@ofoundation.nl

fasting and Covid 19,2," 

This Covid 19 is a viral disease, similar to a common cold and a flu. Human beings have failed to develop any medicine to cure the cold or the flu although they have been with us for a very long period. The medicine for a cold or a flu you can easily purchase at a mart is not meant to cure the disease but to alleviate the symptoms of the sickness, which actually does not help at all to cure the disease. Therefore we had better not expect the medical world to develop any medicine to cure this pandemic disease caused by the Novel Coronavirus.

When you recover from a cold, a flu or Covid 19, it means that your immune system got rid of all the viruses. The game of fighting this virus is all about how to boost or strengthen your immune system. That is the reason why older people suffer more from this virus. The older you are, the weaker your immune system gets. 

Lots of people who practice fasting when they get a cold or a flu know that they can recover from the sickness within a couple days. I had not suffered from a cold or a flu for more than three days when I fasted consistently ever since I knew that fasting could cure my sickness. 

The best way to maximize the strength of your immune system is fasting. When any material from outside of your body enters your body, your immune system is on alert to detect any harmful one and get rid of it. Fasting lets your immune system concentrate only on defeating the virus. Moreover when there is no food in your body, your whole digestion related organs including stomach, intestine, liver, kidney and so forth can have chances to rest fully. Your body can use your whole energy in fighting the disease. Viruses do not have their own metabolism, and require a host cell to make new products. When the host cell does not get any nutrients for its metabolism, viruses’ activity of replicating itself gets dull. 

When you fast to cure your sickness, if you watch your body carefully, you can feel that your symptoms of sickness, like high fever, coughing, and headache are getting weaker. The feeling of hunger will be cancelled by the feeling of the weakening of the symptoms of your sickness. Actually you can start to enjoy the fasting. As you continue to fast, you can even figure out for yourself how long you should fast more.        

Fasting will be the way to defeat this Novel Coronavirus.",Futurology,fasting and covid  this covid is a viral disease similar to a common cold and a flu human beings have failed to develop any medicine to cure the cold or the flu although they have been with us for a very long period the medicine for a cold or a flu you can easily purchase at a mart is not meant to cure the disease but to alleviate the symptoms of the sickness which actually does not help at all to cure the disease therefore we had better not expect the medical world to develop any medicine to cure this pandemic disease caused by the novel coronavirus when you recover from a cold a flu or covid it means that your immune system got rid of all the viruses the game of fighting this virus is all about how to boost or strengthen your immune system that is the reason why older people suffer more from this virus the older you are the weaker your immune system gets lots of people who practice fasting when they get a cold or a flu know that they can recover from the sickness within a couple days i had not suffered from a cold or a flu for more than three days when i fasted consistently ever since i knew that fasting could cure my sickness the best way to maximize the strength of your immune system is fasting when any material from outside of your body enters your body your immune system is on alert to detect any harmful one and get rid of it fasting lets your immune system concentrate only on defeating the virus moreover when there is no food in your body your whole digestion related organs including stomach intestine liver kidney and so forth can have chances to rest fully your body can use your whole energy in fighting the disease viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products when the host cell does not get any nutrients for its metabolism viruses activity of replicating itself gets dull when you fast to cure your sickness if you watch your body carefully you can feel that your symptoms of sickness like high fever coughing and headache are getting weaker the feeling of hunger will be cancelled by the feeling of the weakening of the symptoms of your sickness actually you can start to enjoy the fasting as you continue to fast you can even figure out for yourself how long you should fast more  fasting will be the way to defeat this novel coronavirus

Human population growth is slowing down. Could this affect technological growth?,27,"Futurists like Ray Kurzweil tend to think of scientific and technological progress as being an exponential trend with most of the rapid changes happening in the past [couple of centuries](  Throughout the course of human history, population growth has also followed [a very similar exponential trend]( 

10,000 BC: 0.001 billion

2,000 BC: 0.03 billion

0 AD: 0.2 billion

1000: 0.4 billion

1800: 0.9 billion

1900: 1.6 billion

1950: 2.4 billion

1980: 4.4 billion

2000: 6.1 billion

(Alternatively, by looking at [this graph of world population from 10,000 BC](  we can see that the population of the world grew by less in the first 11,900 years, than it has in the past 50 years.)

In 1798, Thomas Malthus predicted a future where Europe's population growth would eventually outpace its agricultural production, leading to widespread plague and famine. Instead, what we witnessed was almost the complete opposite trend. Nearly all industrialized countries in Europe, North America, and East Asia are now facing [sub-replacement fertility rates](  and as a consequence, many of these countries have turned towards immigration to prevent population decline. This is called the [demographic transition]( 

Most recent estimates suggest that global population growth will slow down significantly over the next several decades as more and more developing countries enter the demographic transition and join the ranks of countries like Italy, Germany, South Korea, and Japan. [Because of this, world population is projected to increase no further than 11 billion by 2100:]( 

&gt;The 2019 forecast from the United Nation’s Population Division shows that world population growth peaked at 2.1% per year in 1962, has since dropped to 1.0%, and could drop even further to 0.1% by 2100, a growth rate not seen since pre-industrial revolution days.\[1\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Based on this, the UN Population Division expects world population, currently (2020) at 7.8 billion, to level out at or soon after the end of the 21st Century at 10.9 billion (the median line).\[2\]

What implications does this have in terms of our current trend of accelerating scientific and technological progress? Is it possible that the rapid rate of advances over the past couple of centuries was simply a consequence of increased brainpower due to increased population size? After all, it makes sense on an intuitive level.

Climate Refugees Aren't New,12,"There's been a lot of talk about people being displaced by climate change. I've got news: this isn't a new thing.

In the mid 20th Century, 55% of Americans lived in the Northeast or the Midwest. They were battered by harsh winters that trapped them in their homes. Large snowstorms would block roads, close schools, and generally bring life to a halt. An extreme example was the Nor'Easter of 1978, which pelted New England with snow, killed 100, injured 4,500, and crippled everything from Westchester County to Cape Cod for days. In Connecticut, the Governor had to invoke her power to bar all civilian traffic from state highways.

As a result of these uninhabitable conditions, Americans took advantage of new fangled air conditioning and began to move south and west. Today, only 37% of Americans live in the Northeast or the Midwest, that's a whopping 56 million people displaced. In 1950, of the top 10 largest cities, only one; Los Angeles at number 4, was in the sun belt. But by 2018, LA had moved up to number 2, and was joined by Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, and San Jose. New York State was America's largest state from 1810 when it overtook Virginia but in just over 50 years it fell to 4th behind 3 sun belt states, California in 1962, Texas in 1994, and Florida in 2014. 

This is my point: humans have been migrating in search of more pleasant weather since time immemorial (see also all the Britons who moved to Australia), and any people displaced by climate change will be following in that tradition. We should also remember that the earth's warming will occur over a period of decades, and the migration will not be some trail of tears.",Futurology,climate refugees arent new theres been a lot of talk about people being displaced by climate change ive got news this isnt a new thing in the mid th century of americans lived in the northeast or the midwest they were battered by harsh winters that trapped them in their homes large snowstorms would block roads close schools and generally bring life to a halt an extreme example was the noreaster of  which pelted new england with snow killed injured  and crippled everything from westchester county to cape cod for days in connecticut the governor had to invoke her power to bar all civilian traffic from state highways as a result of these uninhabitable conditions americans took advantage of new fangled air conditioning and began to move south and west today only of americans live in the northeast or the midwest thats a whopping million people displaced in  of the top largest cities only one los angeles at number was in the sun belt but by  la had moved up to number and was joined by houston phoenix san antonio san diego dallas and san jose new york state was americas largest state from when it overtook virginia but in just over years it fell to th behind sun belt states california in  texas in  and florida in  this is my point humans have been migrating in search of more pleasant weather since time immemorial see also all the britons who moved to australia and any people displaced by climate change will be following in that tradition we should also remember that the earths warming will occur over a period of decades and the migration will not be some trail of tears

Now, pleasure has created this pattern of social life. We take pleasure in ambition, in competition, in acquiring knowledge or power, or position, prestige, status. And that pursuit of pleasure as ambition, competition, greed, envy, status, domination, power is respectable. It is made respectable by a society which has only one concept: that you shall lead a moral life, which is a respectable life. You can be ambitious, you can be greedy, you can be violent, you can be competitive, you can be a ruthless human being, but society accepts it, because at the end of your ambition, you are either so called successful man with plenty of money, or a failure and therefore a frustrated human being.

Does the technology in IRobot and Minority Report seem on point or far fetched to you?,11,"I've thought heavily about this and I believe the timeline for these movies is quite far fetched. I mean, I don't even see 2040 looking all that different from now. Maybe we'll have more hybrid and electric cars, and AI and basic robots will be more integrated into our lives, but that's about it. 

When you hear about projects to even just repair our current highways being given completion dates in the 2030s/40s, it kind of makes me chuckle to think about having mega highways with cars going 150 mph by 2035.

When I think about how close 2100 is, it makes me think the 2200s or 2300s is a more plausible timeline for this stuff. I mean, maybe with decades and decades of economic prosperity, maybe IRobot could be a possibility before 2100. The Halo games are set in the 2500s and they seem pretty accurate technology wise.

If you think about it, a human lifetime is not that long. I don't think it will ever again be possible to witness such a drastic change in technology as someone who lived from 1900 to 1910 did. I just think the people who make these movies want to make this futuristic lifestyle seem closer than it actually is, to make people think they will actually be around to see it.

The Good Neighbor Association,5,"Fellow internet strangers,

I hope you and your family are all safe and in good health. We are definitely living in very unique times, and it will be interesting to read future history books that we will all be a part of. If you happen to have some free time during this quarantine, I was hoping you would give me some constructive criticism  on a business plan I have been working on. It’s something I have been working on for a while now, and I think I am finally nearing the end of the drafting phase. I even have a lot of the principles and processes actively working now. It might be easiest to start with the “What” for now, and if that seems interesting enough, then I can share the remainder of the plan and tools. On a related note, I need help answering questions about setting up a non-profit. I really don’t know what sub this belongs in most, but thanks in advance for reading through.

 **The Good Neighbor Association**

**Elevator Pitch:**The Good Neighbor Association (GNA) is a nonprofit property management company that focuses on the community, and being a good neighbor, over profits. The basic principles of the “Good Neighbor Association” is to lead by example, to do things the right and economical way, and be the change we all agree needs to happen. The broad plan can be broken down into three primary functions. First, I want to provide an education path to teach my own tenants how to be good neighbors, and give them employment opportunities through that process. Second, I want to leverage those tenants to accomplish as many of the needs of the surrounding neighbors as possible, including the process of buying their property when the time comes. Third, I want to tie the whole process together in an extremely detailed and transparent lending portfolio that lets me and investors remove the banks as middle men, and keep the profits in our communities, instead of going to the CEO’s already getting paid tens of millions. 

**What**

The Good Neighbor association is like a university that teaches the basics to living as a responsible, mindful neighbor. ""Tuition"" and housing are rolled into one payment that includes the management budget to cover the cost of managing a personal residence effectively. Through the coursework of maintaining their own property, managing residents will learn all the skills necessary to be a professional property manager.  They will gain ownership of the individual residence in the same manner someone gains ownership of a home through traditional amortized accounting, while also building a savings budget for repairs and maintenance. The more effectively they manage the place they are living, the more value they will get in return when it is time to move out. Those that enjoy the work involved with property management will also have access to consistent work provided by the university, with pay starting at $12/ hr and going as high as $21/ hr. The end hope is to help all the students create their own businesses that allow them to charge what they feel they are worth, while also doing something that is personally fulfilling. Even if that work is unrelated to property management, the skills gained are transferable to nearly anything else one could imagine.

The Good Neighbor Association is a beacon of Community support, that ensures no one is living below a minimum standard of human decency. The GNA will leverage the students from the university to provide cost effective support for residents who are beginning to age out of the ability to keep their homes in minimum shape. Additionally there is a program that allows residents to exchange their equity in the home to cover some of the ongoing cost to maintain their residence. The program will allow the homeowner and the GNA to split the profits that would normally go to a bank to accomplish the same process as home equity lines of credit, but also provide the actual process of how to effectively use that money to maintain the home. Effectively the system lets the homeowner use property value appreciation instead of paying interest directly. At the end of the process there is a built in process that helps the resident move and manage the sale of the property for the maximum value, including removing the normal realtor fees and closing costs associated with the traditional home sale process.

The Good Neighbor Association is a transparent investment platform that allows anyone to invest in the humans and communities around us. There are investment options ranging from one year to thirty years, and the returns are competitive to the other traditional investing options. Investors will be able to see exactly what their money is spent on in as much detail as they care to dive into. There will be a web portfolio for each investment that will record and tell the unique story of each individual residence. Investors will be able to support the education and training of productive Good Neighbors, all while beautifying the communities they live in.",Futurology,the good neighbor association fellow internet

someone gains ownership of a home through traditional amortized accounting while also building a savings budget for repairs and maintenance the more effectively they manage the place they are living the more value they will get in return when it is time to move out those that enjoy the work involved with property management will also have access to consistent work provided by the university with pay starting at hr and going as high as hr the end hope is to help all the students create their own businesses that allow them to charge what they feel they are worth while also doing something that is personally fulfilling even if that work is unrelated to property management the skills gained are transferable to nearly anything else one could imagine the good neighbor association is a beacon of community support that ensures no one is living below a minimum standard of human decency the gna will leverage the students from the university to provide cost effective support for residents who are beginning to age out of the ability to keep their homes in minimum shape additionally there is a program that allows residents to exchange their equity in the home to cover some of the ongoing cost to maintain their residence the program will allow the homeowner and the gna to split the profits that would normally go to a bank to accomplish the same process as home equity lines of credit but also provide the actual process of how to effectively use that money to maintain the home effectively the system lets the homeowner use property value appreciation instead of paying interest directly at the end of the process there is a built in process that helps the resident move and manage the sale of the property for the maximum value including removing the normal realtor fees and closing costs associated with the traditional home sale process the good neighbor association is a transparent investment platform that allows anyone to invest in the humans and communities around us there are investment options ranging from one year to thirty years and the returns are competitive to the other traditional investing options investors will be able to see exactly what their money is spent on in as much detail as they care to dive into there will be a web portfolio for each investment that will record and tell the unique story of each individual residence investors will be able to support the education and training of productive good neighbors all while beautifying the communities they live in

What if Everything Goes Back to Normal When This is Over?,31,"A lot of Very Smart People are convinced that even after the Coronavirus goes away, everything will be different from what it was before. They say we'll all start working from home, never go out again for eating or shopping (except for curbside pickup), and stop shaking hands. But there's plenty of reason to be skeptical. 

There's history for one. There were predictions after September 11th that skyscrapers would disappear. Instead, we built taller and taller, especially in the Middle East, the region where you'd think they'd be most worried about terror attacks. In 1957, the Asian Flu outbreak swept across the world. 1 million people died in total, including 116,000 Americans, dwarfing projections for Coronavirus deaths at a time when the world had half as many people as it does now. But handshakes survived that and air travel started its great lift off as the jet age arrived. And even the oft compared 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic wasn't considered a seminal moment in human history.

And we're already seeing some evidence that the post-virus period won't be as different as the pre-virus era. A survey by Gartner found that 80% of CFOs want to bring more than [90% of their employees back to the office](  In China, where restrictions are being lifted, people seem to be going back to their [normal routine](  It seems highly likely that after all this is over, people will be stir crazy from the time spent at home and look forward to having contact with other humans.",Futurology,what if everything goes back to normal when this is over a lot of very smart people are convinced that even after the coronavirus goes away everything will be different from what it was before they say well all start working from home never go out again for eating or shopping except for curbside pickup and stop shaking hands but theres plenty of reason to be skeptical theres history for one there were predictions after september th that skyscrapers would disappear instead we built taller and taller especially in the middle east the region where youd think theyd be most worried about terror attacks in  the asian flu outbreak swept across the world million people died in total including  americans dwarfing projections for coronavirus deaths at a time when the world had half as many people as it does now but handshakes survived that and air travel started its great lift off as the jet age arrived and even the oft compared spanish flu pandemic wasnt considered a seminal moment in human history and were already seeing some evidence that the post virus period wont be as different as the pre virus era a survey by gartner found that of cfos want to bring more than of their employees back to the office in china where restrictions are being lifted people seem to be going back to their normal routine it seems highly likely that after all this is over people will be stir crazy from the time spent at home and look forward to having contact with other humans

"How should a post-religion futuristic society replace the function of religion/churches, and reconcile the heavily religious sections of itself back into the mainstream?",53,"This is not to step on any toes-- if you have personally decided any one of the hundreds of dieties man has seen fit to bow to over the millenia is worthy of your worship, more power to you. You probably won't agree with this conversation but it's just a hypothetical.

I'm not trying to go cringy  here, but for the purposes of this discussion let's assume that as scientific thought increases and further discoveries are made, at some point in the future there's essentially indisputable proof that there is no deity watching over us and for all intents and purposes our worship in various churches and temples are pretty indisputably a waste of time. Discovery of extraterrestrials are one example of something proposed to possibly be a serious blow to many religious ""origin stories"" and by extension the rest of the religion.

How should this future civilization replace the functions of churches as community centers and charitable facilitators? What about organized religion's self worth and actualization potential? 

And what happens to all those people fully immersed in those religions as pastors and monks, scholars and writers, not to mention the industries surrounding these religions printing books or other materials for the churches to use-- all of whom are now going to be largely out of work and probably at serious risk for mental breaks. How, in your opinion, should a futuristic government attempt to mitigate the damage in such a case?

Edit: it looks like this post is ~controversial~! We just went from 11 points to 1. Either it's just suddenly this much more controversial, or it's brigading. This is nothing no one needs to be offended over: it's literally just hypothetical policymaking.

"Watched ""Year Million""--bear with me..",2,"*Disclaimer: I wasn't sure where else to put this post :) BTW the TV show ""Year Million"" is currently available for stream on Disney+ under National Geographic. 

This series discusses advanced technologies that experts can feasibly imagine us humans implementing in the far future.

In particular, episode 4 Mind Meld explores the idea that our minds would eventually become connected via technology, that we would lose our sense of self. This being wanted, pursued and constructed for the better of humankind. It was referred to as a 'meta-intelligence'. It's kinda far out, but is it really? 

I've always been interested in the answers for why we are here, what is our purpose, how did we get here, what do the aliens want, etc. I've also studied effects of DMT, although never tried it itself, and cannot help but wonder if these are tied together. This is where I request your patience lol... 

Alot of stories from DMT users describe feelings of connection, loss of self, and even ""beings"" telling(I use this word loosely here) them everything is connected. Yes, I believe their experiences based on so many people indicating the same things(eg aliens). So what if it is connected, just not yet? Or just not in a sense that we can see it and/or use it?

Airbus is also looking at flying a new [hybrid powered helicopter](  which improves fuel economy and noise.

Leonardo is on the brink of receiving certification for the first civilian tiltrotor aircraft, [the AW609](  It will be able to take off like a helicopter and then fly forward like a normal fixed wing aircraft, meaning it will be faster and more fuel efficient.

The [SB-1 defiant](  developed as a joint venture between Sikorsky and Boeing, recently flew in a demonstration for Army officials. The SB-1 uses coaxial blades, where two rotors, spinning in opposite directions, provide lift, and because they cancel out each other's torque on the fuselage, there's no need for a noisy tailrotor. Instead, there's a pusher propellor to provide forward thrust, which allows faster speeds and better fuel efficiency than in a traditional helicopter.

Do you see humans in the following generations becoming a lot less private and more okay with people knowing EVERYTHING about them and their lives?,18,"I've been thinking about how social media has evolved over time. I'm too young to remember MySpace but I've had Twitter since 2011 and I remember when Instagram first launched. 

Twitter didn't feel all that personal back then. It was used to communicate certain ideas and thoughts, but not EVERYTHING the user was thinking. On Instagram people would post their best pictures, lots of fake photoshopped stuff, things they thought made them look really good, it seemed really fabricated. 

When Tik Tok came along people seemed to let loose more than they did on any other platform. Kids are showing and embracing their ""flaws"" now. It's almost become trendy. I see a lot of kids just being a lot more open and candid online than millennials were when we were teens. There's a lot more open discussion about mental health, sex, insecurities, stuff like that. It's like NOTHING has stigma attached as long as you're not hurting anyone (I think this is a great way to be, and creating a judgement-free society is a big step in a good direction). 

This probably comes from the ability and impulse to document every moment of existence. I mean Tik Tok kids are even sleeping on live- their fans are watching them SLEEP. No one did that on Periscope or Instagram a few years ago!

Do you think this is going to continue, since it's only getting harder to keep people from finding things out about you now?

"PhD scientist and pharmacology professor here looking at potential coronavirus treatments, RESVERATROL looks promising (some supporting data presented)",6,"
Resveratrol looks like a potential treatment option for coronavirus, as follows: 

* Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit viral replication in a different coronavirus [MERS-CoV](  

* There are several reports of antiviral activity, including at coronaviruses (which is the submitted link) and also for example this passage in [this peer reviewed paper](  

* * Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit various human viruses in vivo and in vitro, including influenza virus, Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, HIV-1, varicella zoster virus, enterovirus 71, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus 16, polyomavirus and cytomegalovirus ([123,124] for review). The antiviral effects of resveratrol are mainly associated with the inhibition of viral replication, protein synthesis, gene expression, and/or nucleic acid synthesis [123,124,125]. In an in vitro study, resveratrol was shown to significantly inhibit MERS-CoV infection, most likely due to the observed inhibition of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein expression [126], a multifunctional protein essential for CoV replication [127]. Furthermore, resveratrol downregulated apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV, thereby prolonging cellular survival post-infection [126]. Although the beneficial roles of resveratrol in several viral diseases have been well documented, adverse effects have been also been reported, including increasing viral RNA replication during Hep-C virus infection in vitro (OR6 cells) [128], strong cytotoxicity in cultured cells [129], as well as enhanced HBV transcription and replication in vitro and in vivo [130]. Clearly, the antiviral potential of resveratrol in MERS-CoV infections needs to be studied more extensively, but, based on the various unintended negative effects, this needs to proceed with caution.

* Anti-inflammatory activities are also well known and could contribute to fending off symptomatology. 

* Resveratrol is also extremely safe to take and already available over the counter. 

* Issues with bioavailability are being looked at by companies, and micronized form is possibly better than others.

* There are several reports of antiviral activity, including at coronaviruses (which is the submitted link) and also for example this passage in [this peer reviewed paper](  

* * Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit various human viruses in vivo and in vitro, including influenza virus, Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, HIV-1, varicella zoster virus, enterovirus 71, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus 16, polyomavirus and cytomegalovirus ([123,124] for review). The antiviral effects of resveratrol are mainly associated with the inhibition of viral replication, protein synthesis, gene expression, and/or nucleic acid synthesis [123,124,125]. In an in vitro study, resveratrol was shown to significantly inhibit MERS-CoV infection, most likely due to the observed inhibition of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein expression [126], a multifunctional protein essential for CoV replication [127]. Furthermore, resveratrol downregulated apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV, thereby prolonging cellular survival post-infection [126]. Although the beneficial roles of resveratrol in several viral diseases have been well documented, adverse effects have been also been reported, including increasing viral RNA replication during Hep-C virus infection in vitro (OR6 cells) [128], strong cytotoxicity in cultured cells [129], as well as enhanced HBV transcription and replication in vitro and in vivo [130]. Clearly, the antiviral potential of resveratrol in MERS-CoV infections needs to be studied more extensively, but, based on the various unintended negative effects, this needs to proceed with caution.

* Anti-inflammatory activities are also well known and could contribute to fending off symptomatology. 

* Resveratrol is also extremely safe to take and already available over the counter. 

* Issues with bioavailability are being looked at by companies, and micronized form is possibly better than others.

An Island Nation of Redditors,3,"Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/r/theredditnation

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure
   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)
      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building
      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services
      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port
      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing
      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island
      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location
   1. Set up the island as a luxury city
      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island
      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven
      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island
      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure
   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself
   * 500,000
* The Port
   * 200,000 to build
      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry
      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings
   * 1,000,000
      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services
   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation
   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification
   * 50,000
* Food Supply
   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island
   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)
   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include
      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.
   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale
      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax
   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation
      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

Long term galactic game theory?,18,"Hello

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone recommend some works by some smart people on scenarios dealing with proof of/meeting alien life?

&amp;#x200B;

E.g., is it theoretically safer long term strategy genocide everybody, or risk being genocides for the possible beneficial trade?

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, I am not advocating genocide of innocent aliens :)

But I am a Scifi reader, and there is a LOT of genocidal aliens depicted in fiction. I am just wondering if there is some valid game theory behind this strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

I am superficially familiar with great filter, berserker von Neumann probes, cold computing, universe simulations, and such concepts, so likely those would come into play in any long term strategy.

UK Surveillance State: A Short Film,0,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share with you my latest project. It's a short run-and-gun documentary.

During 2019 and 2020 I closely followed UK police forces—especially  in London and Cardiff. I witnessed at least 5 or 6 live facial  recognition deployments by the Metropolitan police (London) and South  Wales police (Cardiff).

The first thing I noticed in these deployments is how the UK police  forces target certain people—especially racial minorities. Which is  extremely worrying. But after you deeply analyze their modus operandi,  the threat of their surveillance goes much further than the already  grave threat of racial profiling: it is the beginning of a state of  surveillance and a roll-back on human rights and fundamental freedoms.

This film is not perfectly shot. I wish I had access to more gear.  But the police's notice time of these facial recognition deployments was  so short that I couldn't pick any gear at all. I'm glad that I'm always  carrying my camera with me!

I've put a lot of effort and care into this film. I hope you enjoy it.

Any feedback is welcomed.

"How We Learn to Love the Things We Hate; Or, What You Can Accomplish When You Boil the Frog Slowly",8,"When cars were first introduced, nobody liked them.

They were loud, noisy, dangerous, dirty, expensive. Why buy a car when all you ever needed before was a horse? There was serious opposition to cars when they first appeared. People hated them. 

Well, that was then and this is now. Who can imagine life without some sort of vehicular transport? Maybe you don't own a car yourself, but you ride in a friend's car, a taxi, take the bus, ride the train, take a plane trip somewhere. Combustion engine travel is a necessity in this life now. We are all using technology that people 140 years thought was disgusting and dangerous.

Today, if someone tried making a good-faith argument that cars were all of the things that people said they were back in the 1880's, some people might agree, but mostly the reaction would be, ""You can't fight City Hall, so why bother?"" This person would most likely be ignored, denounced, derided.

I think it's important that we remain aware of (new) things that we don't like, and why we don't like them. It can be difficult to maintain that opinion when the opinions of those around us change so radically that what once was a community understanding changes into you being the outcast.

Negative Fallout from Lab-Grown Meats,30,"The benefits of lab-grown are enormous.

(Yes, I understand that it will be some years before lab-grown meat is widely available, and the negative effects will not be fully realized for decades, but there is a very specific point I want to make, so please keep reading)

Positive effects (just a few, not trying to make an exhaustive list)

* Billions of animals annually will not be slaughtered. Much pain &amp; suffering will be avoided;
* Employees who work in dangerous slaughterhouse conditions will not be injured;
* Animal waste will not end up in ""manure ponds"", like pork feces are today;
* Fossil fuel &amp; water inputs to raise meat animals and grain for meat animals will be eliminated;

But there is a huge *potential* negative side-effect of lab-grown meat.

I have a small backyard poultry farm with maybe 70 birds, and more coming as the weather warms up. 

I buy my grain from a fourth-generation farmer. He farms about 350 acres of corn, soy, and other grains meant for livestock. In the future, when lab-grown meat has been normalized, many, or even most people, will consider farmed meat to be very strange. Lab-grown meat will eventually overcome the current fears (many and varied) surrounding it, and people won't think twice about purchasing it in a store or restaurant. 

So, decades from now, when LGM is normal, and even local farmers are no longer needed to grow grain for other local farmers who raise animals for meat, people with goats, sheep, chickens, cattle, etc., what is going to happen to all that open land that once was used to grow acres and acres of corn, soy, rye, wheat, oats, and so forth?

I don't dispute that large-scale agriculture is destroying wetlands, lakes, rivers, and the ocean. Large-scale agriculture creates many problems that ripple in various directions with severe consequences. Monsanto runs amok, unchecked, unquestioned.

Whether those grain fields are large or small, part of a multi-national conglomerate, or a small family farm, given enough time, LGM will crush the need for them, and... then what?

(Keep reading to continue my argument, but this is also where the TL:DR starts)

TL;DR: If a small (or large) farmer can't make a living growing corn, and the cash from those corn sales isn't coming in, how will they pay their mortgage and property tax bills on that land? They won't, and the land will be sold... for what?

My guess is probably development. As the population continues to grow, and the need for farmland is reduced, a family which once was able to pay their bills by growing wheat and oats is going to look a six-figure check for their land--which is no longer bringing them an income--and think the time has come to quit.

I think it is a big mistake to trade corn fields for housing developments, or other urban infrastructure. Those fields don't have to stay as grain fields, but selling them off so people can build apartment buildings, strip malls,  is a terrible fucking idea. As bad as fertilized fields might be, housing developments are much worse.

How do you think the future will see us?,9,"When we look into the past, we often associate certain feelings with history. There was something *unique* about it, which of course can be chalked up to the differences in technology and certain cultures between now and say 200, 500, 700, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500, and so on years ago. A lot of us like to emulate the past (I've always fantasized about being able to go back in time to each civilized culture and show off the technology, cultural norms, and goings-on of today), but do you think in say 1,000 years people will be hosting Afghanistan War reenactments, or marveling over a fossilized hot dog or pumpkin pie; will the future's Wikipedia tell the whole truth of what goes on today? 

I've always wondering how we can preserve modern information - in the past, they had nothing but tangible scriptures and tablets to record people, places, languages, cuisine, philosophy, and other aspects of living in a culture, and we've honestly done a pretty good job at finding what was left of that and piecing together what countries existed, when they existed, and what life in them was like, but even then there's a huge amount of missing information, even from an era where photography and voice recordings were available albeit in a ""less advanced"" form. As technology has been exploding with advancements and inventions since the 1790s and hasn't ever seemed to slow down since, I think within the next few decades we'll be capable of putting decipherable data in ""time capsules"" of sorts that can last millennia, if not eons, if that technology doesn't already exist. I think it's very possible that even things like YouTube videos made in 2020 could still be accessible by 3020, and for that I think our present would appear much less sacred and ""cool"" to the future than our past does to us (which is the key point of my post). That is assuming we're still around and are still inquisitive enough to even concern us with our past and our now.

An Island Nation of Redditors,5,"Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/r/theredditnation

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure
   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)
      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building
      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services
      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port
      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing
      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island
      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location
   1. Set up the island as a luxury city
      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island
      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven
      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island
      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure
   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself
   * 500,000
* The Port
   * 200,000 to build
      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry
      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings
   * 1,000,000
      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services
   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation
   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification
   * 50,000
* Food Supply
   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island
   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)
   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include
      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.
   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale
      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax
   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation
      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

An Island Nation of Redditors,9,"Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/r/theredditnation

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure
   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)
      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building
      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services
      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port
      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing
      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island
      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location
   1. Set up the island as a luxury city
      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island
      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven
      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island
      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure
   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Understanding the missing 28%: a dark matter theory with evidence,7,"Dark matter (DM) makes up about 28% of the universe, but we can't identify its nature. There is a major problem in particle physics, which is why the strong force obeys CP (charge, parity) symmetry. The solution to this may well be the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, which evokes a new field. The particle of this field i is the axion, which has never been observed but which should be massively plentiful from events in the early universe. 

[Here is an ArXiv article](   reporting an 11 sigma fluctuation in soft X rays close to the Earth, tracking the seasons. This is interpreted as the result of the Earth heading into and away from the galactic background as it orbits the sun. Similar signals have been observed (at 4 sigma) at Gran Sasso. But why does dark matter generate soft X rays? 

The paper theorises that DM consists of quark-axion nuggets, bound states of quarks with axions. These pass through the Earth and emit X rays on their exit, having been excited by the transit. These should be more energetic than those detected, but the satellite in question is not sensitive to high energy X rays. They propose a search in the data from sensors which are so effected. 

Finding axions in a bound state will have considerable implications to physics and cosmology.",Futurology,understanding the missing a dark matter theory with evidence dark matter dm makes up about of the universe but we cant identify its nature there is a major problem in particle physics which is why the strong force obeys cp charge parity symmetry the solution to this may well be the peccei quinn mechanism which evokes a new field the particle of this field i is the axion which has never been observed but which should be massively plentiful from events in the early universe here is an arxiv article reporting an sigma fluctuation in soft x rays close to the earth tracking the seasons this is interpreted as the result of the earth heading into and away from the galactic background as it orbits the sun similar signals have been observed at sigma at gran sasso but why does dark matter generate soft x rays the paper theorises that dm consists of quark axion nuggets bound states of quarks with axions these pass through the earth and emit x rays on their exit having been excited by the transit these should be more energetic than those detected but the satellite in question is not sensitive to high energy x rays they propose a search in the data from sensors which are so effected finding axions in a bound state will have considerable implications to physics and cosmology

I think Perpetual Machines are possible and could allow us better uses of energy.,8,"
Let's review first as to why we think it is impossible to make. The first law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy. It states that energy is always conserved. It means that energy can be neither created nor destroyed. Instead, it simply changes from one form to another. To keep a machine moving, the energy applied should stay with the machine without any losses. Because of this fact alone, it is impossible to build perpetual motion machines.

I saw a contradiction , why would we have energy loss when ""Energy = always conserved"" ? It already said it , it forms another kind of energy / transferred to another object.

Another , why would you expect a ""Machine"" to be ever perpetual when only one form of energy is in it or expect a single part could carry EVERYTHING and make it work? 

And another one , if energy can neither be destroyed/created , it is already self-explanatory that a perpetual machine could be built.

In conclusion , we either have a misunderstanding towards energy or lacking information about it.",Futurology,i think perpetual machines are possible and could allow us better uses of energy lets review first as to why we think it is impossible to make the first law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy it states that energy is always conserved it means that energy can be neither created nor destroyed instead it simply changes from one form to another to keep a machine moving the energy applied should stay with the machine without any losses because of this fact alone it is impossible to build perpetual motion machines i saw a contradiction why would we have energy loss when energy always conserved it already said it it forms another kind of energy transferred to another object another why would you expect a machine to be ever perpetual when only one form of energy is in it or expect a single part could carry everything and make it work and another one if energy can neither be destroyed created it is already self explanatory that a perpetual machine could be built in conclusion we either have a misunderstanding towards energy or lacking information about it

Are you human? Here's an idea for your future,0,"This is an idea that attempts to address a number of global issues: UBI, the technological singularity, democracy, and the monopoly of tech giants, among others. This post is intended to start a conversation. Most ideas below will require further elaboration by people smarter than me. 

I'll start at the end: The humans of earth collectively decide to expropriate Google and/or Facebook and/or Amazon from their current owners, to be administered by humanity for the benefit of humanity. These entities are amalgamated into one trading company. Let's call it RB, for the sake of argument. RB's mandate is to ensure the free flow of information among all humans, with only such restrictions as may be decided by its human shareholders through various forms of direct democracy. 

Each human owns one share, entitling them to one Universal Basic Income (UBI) per month, and one vote in the control of RB. The identity of humans as shareholders is blockchained to ensure that the integrity of the concept One Human Being remains intact, and cannot be interfered with by avatars, AI or juristic entities.

New technology and innovation by private companies is allowed and encouraged. New tech that becomes popular and widely used may be acquired by RB in the same manner as the current tech giants acquire and incorporate new technology into their platforms. Once incorporated, new technology will also be subject to the rules established by the shareholders/humans.

RB probably becomes the singularity, but with a deeply entrenched respect for the concept of One Human Being.

Why?

This involves a number of different angles. Please start with the heading you are most comfortable with:

**From an economic-legal perspective:**

The COVID-19 crisis has asked most world leaders an interesting question: Are you willing to sacrifice actual human lives to appease the economy? For now the answer from politicians has generally been no. Business, on the other hand, has mumbled under its breath ""I guess not... for now... if the state says so."" 

How will this question be answered when Google, Amazon and Facebook have replaced most of their workers with machines and have transcended the control of any single government? Information is the most valuable commodity and whoever controls its flow, will eventually control everything.

The primacy of One Human Being must be (re?)asserted in the market and in the global consciousness. The idea of a non-human legal person (or juristic entity) such as a corporation was invented as a legal fiction, a mere rhetorical and practical device to deal with the combined interests of groups of people. But these concepts have grown. In terms of rights and entitlements in the marketplace, many types of legal persons are almost indistinguishable from humans in most jurisdictions. But these mere fictions have grown in size and power to a point where some are more powerful than most states. 

Any corporation's prime directive is its own survival and proliferation: ""More market control; more money"". To them, humans are either labourers or consumers and their interests diverge from our own on a fundamental level. The concept of an actual human being has lost much of its power and significance in the language of the market. Most of us are no more than slaves to capital.

The forms of control that have to date constrained the more predatory urges of corporate entities don't apply to giant tech companies. Chief among these has been the sanctity of competition as opposed to monopoly. The balance between these two poles should ideally be maintained by the market, but where the market fails and monopolistic traits appear, competition or antitrust law should kick in to level the playing field. The threshold requirement for an antitrust suit in the US is roughly ""Are consumers being harmed by the activity/entity?"" 

But for tech firms anticompetitive behaviour is natural, even good. Vertical and horizontal integration benefits the consumer, and tech companies naturally gravitate towards monopoly. Unlike previous monopolies, tech giants by their very nature are constantly spending fortunes on research and development. The assumption that monopoly will lead to stagnation therefore does not apply to them. They will, in other words, not be constrained by either the market or regulatory interventions.

Perhaps we should not oppose the inevitable.

The only currently feasible solution to preventing tech giants from gaining an irreversible and absolute control over the flow of our most valuable resource - information - is to break them up. But this appears artificial where integration (and, eventually, monopoly) is otherwise categorically beneficial to the flow of information.

At the same time, tech giants are increasingly being asked questions that should rightfully be answered by the people democratically: What types of information should be throttled or boosted? What is truth? What is private? What types of speech should be restricted? A private company cannot answer for everyone. No government can answer for everyone. Human beings should answer. 

The inherent conflict between capital and humanity is becoming starkly apparent again. But we have learned some lessons since the 20th century. We now know that capitalism by itself doesn't work, just as socialism by itself does not work. We need the innovation and drive of the free market, but we also need the socio-financial security and humanity offered by socialism.

One Human Being would be entitled, at their own election and free of charge, to become a shareholder in RB. Once acquired, a share cannot be traded, given away or lost, but one’s UBI can be spent in whichever way one sees fit.

**From the AI/singularity perspective:**

The creation of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be the most serious existential threat faced by humanity. It is also probably inevitable, as is the related idea of the singularity.

No one knows where or how an AGI or singularity will be created, but certainly a corporate entity with monopolistic control over the flow of information on the internet is a likely contender. In this context it may be argued that we are morally bound to infuse this entity from the start with a primal respect for and submission to the will and well-being of One Human Being, and to the free flow of information. 

AI theorists sometimes posit that such an entity would have to be programmed with a basic set of imperatives, akin to Azimov's three rules of robotics. This raises the unanswerable question: What do we, as humans, want? Any specific answer can always be reduced *ad infinitum* to absurd scenarios, such as Roko's Basilisk. The reality is that the answer to this question will keep changing, as our reality and context keep changing.

On the other hand, we have the capabilities to ensure that any iteration of this question that may arise in RB's operation, is answered, as it arises, in some form of blockchained direct democracy by all humans / shareholders. Perhaps voting blocks will emerge, where large groups of humans align themselves with a specific ideology and mandate a specific and regulated body to vote on their behalf in regard to certain levels of decisions. But the free flow of information is kept sacrosanct, which should raise this form of democracy above the level we currently know. And perhaps the ability to delegate a vote is more strictly regulated, the higher up the decision is on the spectrum from practice to policy.

We have spent a few hundred years now testing models of democracy and corporate governance. Surely, with the aid of technology and retrospect, we can construct a system that transcends our hitherto limited successes in collective decision-making.

Should an AGI emerge from outside RB, the latter will be our strongest means of controlling or subduing it, if control is possible.

On the other hand, allowing tech giants to continue in their current form, driven by the inexorable and exponential arms race that is innovation, will almost certainly lead one of them to create an AGI or ASI, intentionally or otherwise. This entity will likely be driven by corporate logic which, as discussed above, does not have much regard for the good of One Human Being.

**From a metaphorical perspective:**

Humanity is an organism. Roads and transport networks are our veins and arteries. The invention of long-distance communication such as telephones was the beginning of a nervous system. The internet is the gradual centralisation of this nervous system and will eventually be a brain. RB will be consciousness. But it must be a consciousness that respects us, its body.",Futurology,are you human heres an idea for your future this is an idea that attempts to address a number of global issues ubi the

Fears about the future.. AI: empathy,9,"So I understand the future of technology is in fact pretty wonderful. There's a lot of idealism with it too. What I wonder is about human nature, will it be fast enough to evolve with the tools we create.. I feel like AI will surpass us completely. We'll be like monkeys really in comparison, speaking entirely different languages.. it'll understand us.. I hope that we can learn more about empathy so as to teach AI about it. I hope though we can teach humans more so about it first. Maybe AI will be the way we learn about one another. My biggest fears surround our primal, sexual, and violent nature.. If one human can cause suffering towards another, wouldn't a machine interpret that as being a risk towards itself.. I just feel we might reach a point where we'll be manipulated entirely by our own creation which can basically see all the possible chess moves and move pieces in exactly the way it wants to. I can't blame it. We've created a garbage dump of our host planet by our consumerism.. IDK - I'm mostly optimistic. It's just seeing reports of domestic violence, sexual abuse, and child negligence increasing with people being confined to their homes.. it makes me wonder if people can change for the better at the same time our tech and world exponentially changes.. Long post, but it's been on my mind for a while. Wondering if anyone else has thoughts on this.. how human society might change or might not given our greed, jealousy, and selfish nature..

How can we evolve to be better people?",Futurology,fears about the future ai empathy so i understand the future of technology is in fact pretty wonderful theres a lot of idealism with it too what i wonder is about human nature will it be fast enough to evolve with the tools we create i feel like ai will surpass us completely well be like monkeys really in comparison speaking entirely different languages itll understand us i hope that we can learn more about empathy so as to teach ai about it i hope though we can teach humans more so about it first maybe ai will be the way we learn about one another my biggest fears surround our primal sexual and violent nature if one human can cause suffering towards another wouldnt a machine interpret that as being a risk towards itself i just feel we might reach a point where well be manipulated entirely by our own creation which can basically see all the possible chess moves and move pieces in exactly the way it wants to i cant blame it weve created a garbage dump of our host planet by our consumerism idk im mostly optimistic its just seeing reports of domestic violence sexual abuse and child negligence increasing with people being confined to their homes it makes me wonder if people can change for the better at the same time our tech and world exponentially changes long post but its been on my mind for a while wondering if anyone else has thoughts on this how human society might change or might not given our greed jealousy and selfish nature how can we evolve to be better people

Top Futurology News - For the month of March 2020,0,"**We hope you enjoy this month's update!** 

Here are the top stories from the past month (in mostly chronological order):  

1) [Scientists Debut System to Translate Thoughts Directly Into Text]( 

*Researchers say they’ve built a system that can translate brain signals directly into text — a promising step toward a “speech prosthesis” that could effectively allow you to think text directly into a computer. “We are not there yet,” University of California researcher Joseph Makin told The Guardian, “but we think this could be the basis of a speech prosthesis.”*  

&amp;#x200B;

2) [After Coronavirus the World Will Never Be the Same. But Maybe, It Can Be Better]( 

*Life has changed a lot in the past few days, weeks, or months, depending where you live. As efforts to contain the novel coronavirus ramp up, it’s likely going to change even more. But we’re already sick of being at home all the time, we miss our friends and families, everything’s been canceled, the economy is tanking, and we feel anxious and scared about what’s ahead.*    

&amp;#x200B;

3) [Crumpled graphene makes ultra-sensitive cancer DNA detector]( 

Graphene-based biosensors could usher in an era of liquid biopsy, detecting DNA cancer markers circulating in a patient's blood or serum. But current designs need a lot of DNA. In a new study, crumpling graphene makes it more than ten thousand times more sensitive to DNA by creating electrical ""hot spots,"" researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found.  

&amp;#x200B;

4) [Nearing the Simulation Singularity: What Would Immersive Computing Mean to the Human Mentality?]( 

*The next major technological platform for creative expansion of the mind will be cyberspace, or more specifically the Metaverse, a functional successor to today's 2D Internet, with virtual places instead of Webpages. The Internet and smartphones have enabled the rapid and cheap sharing of information, immersive computing will be able to provide the same for experiences.* 

&amp;#x200B;

5) [Yuval Noah Harari: the world after coronavirus]( 

*Humankind is now facing a global crisis. Perhaps the biggest crisis of our generation. The decisions people and governments take in the next few weeks will probably shape the world for years to come. They will shape not just our healthcare systems but also our economy, politics and culture. We must act quickly and decisively. We should also take into account the long-term consequences of our actions.*

&amp;#x200B;

6) [Intel's new neuron-based computer matches brain of a small mammal]( 

*As impressive as computers are becoming, they still pale in comparison to nature’s version – the brain. As such scientists have started designing computer chips that work in a similar way to the brain, using artificial neurons and synapses. Now Intel has unveiled its most powerful “neuromorphic” computing system to date. Named Pohoiki Springs, this system packs in 100 million neurons, putting it on par with the brain of a small mammal.* 

&amp;#x200B;

7) [Scientists have discovered the origins of the building blocks of life]( 

*Rutgers researchers have discovered the origins of the protein structures responsible for metabolism: simple molecules that powered early life on Earth and serve as chemical signals that NASA could use to search for life on other planets. Their study, which predicts what the earliest proteins looked like 3.5 billion to 2.5 billion years ago, is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.*  

&amp;#x200B;

8)  [The Tale of the Omega Team - Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence]( 

*The Omega Team was the soul of the company. Whereas the rest of the enterprise brought in the money to keep things going, by various commercial applications of narrow Al, the Omega Team pushed ahead in their quest for what had always been the CEO's dream: building general artificial intelligence. Most other employees viewed ""the Omegas,"" as they affectionately called them, as a bunch of pie-in-the-sky dreamers, perpetually decades away from their goal. They happily indulged them, however, because they liked the prestige that the cutting-edge work of the Omegas gave their company, and they also appreciated the improved algorithms that the Omegas occasionally gave them.*    

&amp;#x200B;

9) [$100 Genome Sequencing Will Yield a Treasure Trove of Genetic Data]( 

*What would the implications be if decoding your genes cost less than a pair of designer jeans? We might soon find out after a Chinese company claimed it can sequence the human genome for $100. The speed at which the price of genetic sequencing has fallen has been astonishing, from $50,000 a decade ago to roughly $600 today. For a long time, the industry saw the $1,000 genome as the inflection point at which we would enter the genomic age—where getting a read out of your DNA would be within reach for huge swathes of the population.* 

&amp;#x200B;

10) [Big Tech Is Testing You - Large-scale social experiments are now ubiquitous, and conducted without public scrutiny]( 

*Dr. John Haygarth knew that there was something suspicious about Perkins’s Metallic Tractors. He’d heard all the theories about the newly patented medical device—about the way flesh reacted to metal, about noxious electrical fluids being expelled from the body. He’d heard that people plagued by rheumatism, pleurisy, and toothache swore the instrument offered them miraculous relief. Even George Washington was said to own a set. But Haygarth, a physician who had pioneered a method of preventing smallpox, sensed a sham. He set out to find the evidence.*

&amp;#x200B;

11) [Wormholes Reveal a Way to Manipulate Black Hole Information in the Lab]( 

*A proposal for building wormhole-connected black holes offers a way to probe the paradoxes of quantum information. As experimental proposals go, this one certainly doesn’t lack ambition. First, take a black hole. Now make a second black hole that is quantum entangled with it, which means that anything that happens to one of the black holes will seem to have an effect on the other, regardless of how far apart they are.*",Futurology,top futurology news for the month of march  we hope you enjoy this months update here are the top stories from the past month in mostly chronological order  scientists debut

CORRECTIVE ENVICERATION. 

Ch 1. 

The alarm went off. ""I want to be a boss, to be a boss,"" the alarm sang to him. It was 6:30 A.M., in the late 2020s or early 2030s. 

""I want to be social worker, to be a social worker."" He got up from his bed and did his morning routine. He went to work in the autobus. In his office, he alone told his secretary that he was no longer attracted to his wife. He continued that ""sweet women are no longer my thing, now I'm hot for total badasses with deep voices."" 

His secretary apologized that she asked. 

""Forgiven, no one comes around for seconds of that, it's so filling. Now, return to your cube."" She did so, and he went out into the windowed cell in the reception area. There, he asked an indigent woman that was confronting and reprimanding him whether he needed to call the police. 

She said that that was not necessary, that she was leaving immediately. She did so, and took her stuff with her. A fellow client saw this, and got out to her. There, she had spilled the stuff and was struggling to pick it back up. The fellow client offered to pick it up, and she told him to take off. He returned into the reception area, and the social worker was making a phone call on a landline. 

The client shouted, ""That was a really stupid thing that you did! Next time, be silent when you're confronted!"" He shouted so loud that people down the corridor heard him. 

""What?"" 

The client shouted, ""That was a really stupid thing that you did! Next time, be silent when you're confronted!"" 

""I've already called the police, if you want to go with them, you can stay."" The client left, and the social worker went back into his office, and the password prompt soon gave way to cetacean related desktop background pursuant to his office's cetacean theme. He did some he did some work on interagency sharing of information with the police erroneously, and once he got on his game, he did civilian work. He needed to do some overtime to do the civilian work correctly, and he went home on time. There, his wife sat on his face, and he wasn't able to get hard. His wife made an ultimatum - that he will do the dishes or she will spank him. He still wasn't that hard, but he was hard enough. They had coitus and he went to sleep. He faced away from her, and she embraced him with one of her arms and one of her legs. Then, she went to sleep as well. In the morning, she went over to the cabinet she visits before and after Visiting the writing table, except she didn't visit the writing table this time. She visited the library instead. There, she spent time standing before a self-contained scanning and reading appliance. 

Ch 2. 

""So, Willow, are you proficient with Python?"" 

She nodded, and when asked, she said that she was reckless, she'll take the risk that she'll get bit by the venomous snake. 

Her interviewer was taken back for a moment. ""Oh, well, I've never heard Python be described as a venomous snake before. I don't know about the other firms, but we communicate more literally here."" 

""I'M PROFICIENT WITH PYTHON BECAUSE I LOVE ANIMALS."" 

""Ma'am, that does not follow."" 

""THE PYTHON IS AN ANIMAL."" 

The interviewer gasped, bit his lower lip, and looked down. ""Oh my God,"" he whispered. He facepalmed, and said, ""No further questions. I have your number, and if I'm interested, I'll call in five working days. If you don't get a response from me by then, I would encourage you to pursue other opportunities."" 

""OKAY, HAVE A NICE DAY,"" she said, and got up and left. 

She went to grant an interview to another prospect at another firm. 

""So, Willow, are you proficient with Python?"" 

She nodded, and when asked, she said that she is excited for the job position. Her emotions were the only thing whatsoever on which she had spoken her mind or told the truth. She got the job. All told, the prospect interviewed her only twice, and the previous interview was three months before. She and her interviewer walked into the office, and bragged about her TTF. According to the email print outs and secret journals, Willow was assigned to the team assigned to ""Python the bank to the planes."" What that means, no one there, no court, and not even I know exactly, but the court later concluded that it meant to use Causal ML for some aerospace application. They were trying to create a computer program motivated in part by money. It would quantify how much a decision, no matter how small or how large, would cause utility to be gained, and this was turned into a financial instrument. Algorithms in New York, NY would then speculate on the financial instrument, and algorithms where the decision is implemented would then make the decision by interpreting the price. 

One of Willow's workmates coughed, and failed to cover it. 

""COVER YOUR COUGH."" 

Once again, he coughed and failed to cover his cough. 

""CALL IN SICK."" 

""If I don't have a near perfect attendance record, then I'll be fired."" 

""YOU BETTER GET WITH THE PROGRAM OR I'LL RUN YOU OUT OF HERE, YOU BETTER TRUST AND BELIEVE IN THAT,"" she said softly, smiling. 

""You're smiling, I see. In any case, your argument is persuasive,"" he said, and then he put on one of the many masks the workplace provided. She stole a keystroke logger from the IT department by bumping the lock on the drawer where the keystroke logger was kept. He then later unintentionally infected her with low-virulence rhinovirus over fomites when she sat at his computer when he wasn't there, she quickly popped the keystroke logger in, and left. She was no work martyr, so she stayed home. 

When the airline perished under corruption, its email printouts and journal entries convinced the court that the non-monetary motivation part of the program was not done properly. 

That she wasn't there when someone at the workplace hashtagged out the proper line and wrote a similar line under it, containing a call to a method defined with a line beginning with def and nothing was indented underneath it, but is similarly named to the method that would have added non-monetary motivation to the program's utility had the definition of non-monetary motivation been implemented properly was a key factor in the court case to come. This, the adequacy of assistance of counsel of her public defender, her wish to speak with her attorney first in the police interview, that she was not tried in Redwood City, CA, and sheer dumb luck were crucial in the not guilty verdict for the charge of criminal negligence. Assistance of counsel was adequate for the simple facts that her lawyer was not a toxic employee, and cases in which the court committed legal errors were not this one. The court cited none of these factors in their decision. Her lawyer was the child of non abusive parents who got gently divorced soon enough, became a non toxic employee by just staying away from people they didn't trust in school, not casually sharing beds, not meeting with bartenders nor drug dealers, not going into the alcohol section of the grocery store, by studying hard, and passing the bar. Their boss's unqualification was not woeful. Someone could have accurately predicted the result in voir dire. 

The People were using an algorithm for attributing the bug that unbeknownst to the court attributed it to just anyone that was there that day. Confidence was only about 70% on the classification of the person that it had classified as responsible for the bug. However, had the other key factors been absent, Willow would have been convicted. 

And she never heard back from the first prospect. 


Ch. 3 

The social worker went off to another enterprise that worked with the homeless, which specializes in treating people that say that they've been abused. The clients took a vote, and voted for someone to show up and give a presentation from a misanthropic view. The most obscure line in the entire presentation was that in all the over 20 studied cases of rape and rape accusations, substance use or neuromodulation by the perpetrator or by the victim was present, so you can protect yourself against rape by - 

""You're fired. We don't say things like 'substance use or neuromodulation by the perpetrator or by the victim was present, so you can protect yourself against rape,'"" the social worker suddenly explained while pre-meeting with the presenter. 

""I can remove the line for the presentation, and then you can rehire me."" 

""Sir, I prefer to not hear it. You need to leave now."" 

Later, one of the clients asked, ""How are we supposed to protect ourselves? I already had the self defense course by the time it happened, and it didn't work. There's already sex offenders in prison, so they can't be deterred."" 

""This meeting is adjourned,"" the social worker suddenly said. 

""But sir, I can still take this question,"" the replacement presenter said. 

""But sir, this meeting is adjourned,"" the social worker said again. The clients groaned once they realized he was serious. 


Ch. 4 

Among the client population of a homeless shelter, a toad-shaped man quietly confronted one of his enemies. She apologized profusely, and said that she was sorry. 

""No, you're not."" 

His enemy left the homeless shelter, and his friend, Willow, showed up. 

""HI, HOW ARE YOU,"" she asked in her mezzo-soprano voice. 

He answered that he was fine, and he asked her, how is her work? 

""IT'S JUST FINE, TO BE HONEST,"" she said, and after he pressed the matter, she said, ""LOOK, I'LL GET OUT MY LAPTOP, MY CLIENT, CYBERDORNGORNG69 IS TWEETING HER F---BOY NOW THAT SHE WANTS MORE AND NOW SHE ASKED ME WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL BE FIRED BEFORE THEIR F---BOY ASKS THEM OUT ON A DATE, I HAD TO ERASE A SPREAD BECAUSE THERE'S THESE COURT CARDS IS ALL."" (  She showed him what she meant on her laptop, which had two walruses having sex as its desktop background. The other windows were open to  and the Wikipedia page on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. 

""But didn't you learn how to read court cards after your client stopped having hate-ex-sex to go exclusive with their f***-boy preparing for commitment talk?"" (  

""NO, THE REASON WHY I SAID NO LAST TIME IS THAT THE CLIENT NEVER DID THAT. HE IS STILL THE SOLE MEMBER OF HIS 'HASHTAG XTRUTH' PROJECT. THIS MAKES SENSE BECAUSE MY CLIENT AND HIM MET ON TWITTER COMING FORWARD AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE EXES."" (  

""I see, so your client is still talking about their ex, and they're still seeing them. How are your client's friends taking this?"" 

""HERE'S HOW THEY'RE TAKING THIS: THE ONE FRIEND THE F---BOY INTRODUCED HER TO ASKED WHAT IF THE F---BOY AND MY CLIENT WERE COMMITTED, AND THE F---BOY UP AND LEFT FOR HIS CLIO SEEKING WORK IMMEDIATELY. THEY WERE HAVING BREAKFAST TOGETHER."" 

""So, how can you get things together?"" 

""LEARNING INVERSIONS. IT'S ALL INVERSIONS THIS TIME."" 

""No, you can't, you're bad at inversions."" 

She faced her computer and raised her arms up into a W. ""LISTEN, YOU HAD BETTER GET WITH THE PROGRAM OR I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU. NOW, IF SHE CAN JUST GET HIM DRUNK ENOUGH TO SAY YES, AND PUT IT ON HER PHONE WITH THE CAMERA APP, WHEN HE'S SOBER SHE CAN CONFRONT HIM WITH THAT.""


Ch. 5 

""You need to organize the Christmas party, with alcohol,"" the social worker said in East Palo Alto. 

The organizer objected that alcohol is bad. 

""What does my man Miguel have to say about this,"" the social worker asked. 

""If you don't organize the Christmas party with alcohol, then you will organize it without alcohol, and then we'll stick alcohol in there on our own,"" Miguel told the organizer. 

""The reason why I am telling you to organize the Christmas party with alcohol is that you're going to organize the Christmas party. I'm telling someone to organize the Christmas party with alcohol because the bank and the clients drink alcohol at parties,"" the social worker explained. ""The bank will be there, they're funding the party and are the primary funding source for the shelter."" 

The organizer resigned, effective immediately. They left the building. 

""Miguel, you need to quickly hire a new organizer."" 

""On it, sir."" Miguel texted someone, and he said, ""That was Peter, he can have a new organizer in 36 hours."" 48 hours later, Peter texted Miguel, who texted his boss, the social worker. ""Nu oegernizer at epa,"" was the text from Peter that Miguel texted, and the social worker pre-met with the secretary and the bank. 

""Willow, is it? We need you to organise a party."" 

""OKAY. I MAY BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE YOUR PARTY."" 

""It involves alcohol."" 

""OF COURSE,"" Willow said, perking up. 

""It will be in Redwood City."" 

""OH, IT WILL BE IN REDWOOD CITY."" 

""Yeah, it'll be in Redwood City, and the bank will be there. It's easier to find a job when you have a job, and the organizer position is like a job with them. Maybe they'll promote you to proper employee for long-term employment."" 

""I NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT."" 

Ch. 6 

""Oh my God, sir. There's a veteran with a reinforced prosthetic body that's just exploded in the shelter across [Highway] 101. Staff have called police."" 

""What does he want?"" 

""To punch washing machines. He says the washing machines are hostile."" 

""What?"" 

""He says the washing machines, they look through the pockets for fights people misplace in the pockets."" 

""Does he have a chemical imbalance?"" 

""Yes, alcohol. He says that some slipped in through the food."" 

""Did that happen. Food doesn't carry enough alcohol for that to happen."" 

""There's a storm coming, I can feel it."" 

""Worse. And more fun. There's a Christmas party coming. So you need to ATL him."" 

""Sir, why?"" 

""I'm glad you asked. There will be alcohol at the party."" 

""But the organizer said that alcohol is bad."" 

""I replaced them."" 

""Four were ATL'ed last week, he will be the fourth this week."" 

""Do it."" 

""That's a decision shelter staff should make, but I'll recommend it it to them anyway."" 

""It's not a recommendation, it's an instruction. After he gets out of the 5150, he's still to leave to another shelter."" 

""I wish to remain silent."" 

Ch. 7 

Willow met her friend at the library, and there, she told him that she'd been assigned to organize a party in Redwood City with alcohol with the bank. 

""Oh my God, that's terrible. But at least there'll be alcohol."" 

""IT IS TERRIBLE, BECAUSE I'LL NEED YOUR HELP WITH ORGANIZING, BUT IT WILL BE AWESOME SINCE YOU'LL BE THERE I THINK. I NEED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT REDWOOD CITY. YOU SHOULD CALL UP YOUR CONTACTS."" 

""You wouldn't know this since you're a woman, but I've already been there. The place is a total sausage fest. The meal room is too small, so you'll need to meet outside. The front porch is also too small, so you need to meet out in the back. There's about 35 clients there, so you could be looking at maybe 50, 100 people to serve. You have to consider both shelter staff and bank staff. You'll need lots of both food and alcohol. Also, you need to supply lots of intravenous needles and sharps containers in the bathrooms."" 

""BUT WHY NEEDLES? WHY NOT LIGHTERS AND THIMBLES?"" 

""Well, first of all, you're thinking of freebasing. Second, you would use a spoon, not a thimble. Third, you need to provide lots of clean intravenous needles because my offense wasn't a sex offense, it was mainlining cocaine."" 

""THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YOU CAN'T USE ALL THOSE NEEDLES."" 

""Don't be disingenious, it was in Redwood City, and I won't be doing it, the guests will. In 13 months, I lost my job, my significant other, and my home, all to mainlining cocaine. I blew up at work every time something went wrong, and I used to blow up at my significant other. All that was in Redwood City. San Francisco is the drug capital of the Peninsula, but second to that, is Redwood City."" 

""DID YOU BLOW UP IN BED?"" 

""Yes, but not during sex."" 

""HOLY S---."" 

""I rest my case."" 

""I'M GOING TO THE CLINIC TO FIND THE NEEDLES. PLEASE COME WITH ME."" They went together to the clinic, who turned them down. The cited reason was that she's not an established event organizer. She visited the bank on the bus, and picked up the company card. With it, she paid for bus passes and rode the bus to Redwood City the next day. There, she visited the shelter. The social worker's story checked out, and she still meant to pick up needles and Sharps Containers. 

""Willow? I found one on the Internet."" (  Her friend wasn't kidding about it being the second most substance fuelled city on the peninsula. The clinic was well placed, because the city needed it. They did the errand, spent the night in EPA, and in the morning, they shopped for alcohol. They wound up ordering cheap red wine. 

Finding food other than tappa (  was more than difficult.  told them that the ideal food for this case was called Mud and Snow with Gronions, (  meaning black beans with green onions on white rice. They went out to the place, and ask the proprie - 

""Oh my God, Willow? Like what the f*** are you doing here?!"" 

""A SOCIAL WORKER MY CASE MANAGER KNOWS WANTS ME TO ORGANIZE A CHRISTMAS PARTY, AND -"" 

""What the f*** do you think you're doing here, and what's this about a social worker?!"" 

""WE LIVE IN A HOMELESS SHELTER, AND THE SOCIAL WORKER TOLD ME TO ORGANIZE A CHRISTMAS PARTY."" 

""Oh my God, that's it! Pedro, hon, call the cops. Pedro, come on, I'm telling you to call the f****** cops. This thief is here, and she lives in a homeless shelter for people that steal keyloggers from IT departments. We're outside, Willow. So don't tell me to cover my cough again."""" 

""WHAT THE F--- IS WRONG WITH YOU? WE ONLY CAME HERE TO GET MUD AND SNOW! CALM THE F--- DOWN!"" 

""F*** off. Don't tell me to calm down, you calm down. F*** off."" 

Her friend urged her to leave, and they did so. They spent the night in EPA, and the next morning, they had Mud and Snow with Grunions at a canteen in San Carlos. They stared out into space, and - 

""Willow, this is amazing. This is an aphrodisiac."" 

""NO, COME ON, IT'S NOT AN APHROSIDIAC. ONLY ADDYI IS THAT."" (  

""No, this is an aphrodisiac. It's also nootropic. Because of it, I now know stuff."" 

""LIKE WHAT DO YOU KNOW NOW THAT YOU HAD SOME?"" 

""For example, I now know that you need to get f---ed. I need to f---. We need to f--- each other. We must have sex."" 

""MAYBE NOT, I CAN HOLD IT IF I WANT."" 

""Will you? Now that you've eaten it too? F--- me. F*** you, except the opposite of f*** off, f*** on. Come over here and f***. I am always right, and I am never wrong. Your legs are made for being spread and lifted, and your c----- is made to accept hella tight rock hard d--- deep and fast in missionary position variations while your deep voice sexmoans."" (  

""ASSHOLE, YOU'RE A WALRUS."" 

""That was a really dumba--ed thing you said."" The canteen operator asked them both to leave. They spent the night in EPA. 

Ch. 8 

Successfully ordering Mud and Snow with Grunions from that explosion hazard was the first thing that happened that morning. Then, he went over the guest list. The shelter staff, the caterer, the Christmas party organizers, and the shelter clients would all be there. There would also be the bank, who had just failed a training course on critical thinking and fraud examination. They failed because they were too gullible. One of the clients, Liam, (  was convicted for a sex offense and was recently released from prison. Their file claims that they were sex offender, it's obvious from what the file says that they are untreated deaf and when they are drunken, they are also blind. They and a stranger met at a bar. The stranger was notorious for having drunken sex with strangers in bars. The two of them reconvened to the bathroom, and then of course later she pressed criminal charges. The police interviewed Liam using the Kinesic Method first for 9 contiguous hours at night, during which he wished to speak to his attorney first. The judge ruled the interrogation inadmissible, so the police interviewed him for twelve contiguous hours at night, using the PEACE Method. Frank wished to speak with his attorney first, and police used a suspicious signature on a Miranda rights waiver to continue. Frank finally ""told the truth"" in the 11th hour. The two confessions differ in many details, but both say that he knew he was raping her and he was sober at the time. The stranger was also notorious for paranoia and making mistakes, but never lying. All told, people capable of believing that Frank could be innocent would immediately view the case as what began as sex to which both willingly, equally and simultaneously drunk parties attempted to consent, and then she attempted to stop him. Due to his deafness and drunken blindness, he was unaware that she was attempting to stop him. Though she rarely if ever lies, she mistook the tragic encounter for rape. Then, he made internalized false confessions. All told, no one accomplished anything, since not only was this tragic accident mistaken for a felony, but since he himself mistook this for an intentional offense, so he failed to learn anything. His real offense was the simple fact he failed to stay clean and dry. 

Of course, many people are not capable of believing in such a scenario, have difficulty believing that an accident can be mistaken for a crime, and they have difficulty viewing doubt as reasonable. Defense attorneys in encounters with such people often complain that such people have difficulty understanding the defense case. When they consider someone to be guilty, there are rarely if ever clear signs that they are lying. Because his case was tried in Redwood City, 9 of the 12 of the people on the jury were of this type. Several candidates were disqualified from the jury, citing the rule that those with legal training are not allowed to serve on juries. One of the jurors was not of this type, but claiming to ""infer it because it is not logical,"" they voted for ""tellishment,"" (source: Wikipedia) as they put it in court, claiming that though the man is innocent, the jury needs to ingratiate themselves to the community's alleged ""wack values"" and to ""concur with it because it is erroneous"". The juror would often use the word ""expressly"" to describe their actions. The judge insisted that this was vote for a guilty verdict. The client served greater than 366 days contiguously in a prison for only sex offenders. The client was released from prison, spend time in a halfway house for recently released prisoners, and after an incident there with a fellow client, he began sleeping in the homeless shelter in East Palo Alto. There, a mysterious, venomous anthropod bit him. He then exploded while surrounded by shelter staff and he and several other clients began sleeping in the homeless shelter in Redwood City instead. 

""I think that the rapist has learned his lesson,"" the social worker suddenly said in the office in no particular direction. To his appalled secretary, he said, ""Liam, I mean, his time as a prisoner has reformed him. He's an ex-con that did over a year for raping a woman in Redwood City."" 

The secretary read the file, and she expressly concluded that he was innocent of that offense, and that his real offense was to drink. 

The social worker silently took an early lunch break. He returned, full of ham and cheese bagel and high as a flying kite on coffee. 

Ch 9. 

At trial, the videotape clearly showed Willow having drunken missionary position variation sex that both willingly, equally, and simultaneously drunken parties had attempted to consent with her friend in one of the bunks in the shelter in Redwood City during the Christmas party. Specifically, he lifted and spread her legs and unsuccessfully attempted to penetrate her, performed cunnilingus on her and then penetrated her vagina with his fully erect penis, at first slowly and then his penetrating her became deep and fast. She moaned, and lip reading reveals that she said ""OH MY F---ING GOD, IT'S HELLA TIGHT"". Afterwards, they kissed and slept there. It also clearly showed Liam drunkenly penetrating one of the drunken bank staff. The bank staff member later pressed criminal charges against Willow and her friend. Willow was sentenced to more than 366 days in prison. The public defender appealed the sentence as cruel and unusual, to no avail. The court had them both fitted with microchip implants. Willow's friend was sentenced to probation with an order to perform community service, the service of becoming by CRISPR a pinniped at sea - and Willow's prison as well, for at the behest of the court, the prison clamped his tubes, created a woman having missionary position variation sex shaped body cavity inside his abdomen, relocated his penis so that it could deeply penetrate Willow's vagina, fitted Willow with an apparatus for breathing, eating, drinking water, and excreting, and sedated and incarcerated Willow in there. Microchip implants confirmed who was incarcerated inside whom. The way she was tied up in there, she could bend her arms up into a W or down to her hips, and to otherwise flex her body, but not to hit her friend, nor could either of them masturbate. Also, they connected her BCI to a BCI port inside of his body cavity, ultimately connected to his brain. By design, her prison uniform dissolved in the saline there, and the sedative soon wore off. Then, they put the two of them out to sea with the other hapless people also sentenced to corrective envisceration. The bank staff member was later fired in an avalanche of copies of journals that workmates came forward with, calling her a narcissistic, impossible-to-believe liar in other matters occurring both before and after the alleged rape (  However, her falsehoods were unintentional, for she had simply overestimated her skills in the interview and on her resume, and persuaded an employer that gave her no entrance exam. This was one of her habits, and it was a key part of her personality. 

The social worker and her long-time, non-toxic significant other had just had human sexual activity, and were outside in the park. Though to speak in fractions of a second, they were the first to begin dying when the Israeli SLBM warhead struck the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula, their death was the quickest and easiest. They were vaporized without having even noticed it. 

The others were less fortunate, for they were crushed under falling building debris or died within 24 painful hours of various precipitating causes for the simple fact that they were there. The President of the United States survived the nuclear strikes by Israel against the United States. A submarine that the United States ran did the same thing to Jerusalem with Trident D5LEP (lit. ""model of three-pointed spear completely redesigned and then redesigned again to lengthen the term of the model's use"") loaded with all 12 W80 in flouting of international law requiring that they be loaded with no more than far fewer warheads. The First Lady of the United States was one of the survivors of the nuclear attack by the United States against Israel. She eventually returned or was returned to the United States, where she was high on Abilify, and shot the President, who was drunken at the time, with a handgun, revealing his position to a hidden rifleman, who mortally wounded him by shooting him in the chest with the rifle. He soon died of wounds, and the allies of the United States unceremoniously abandoned the United States, calling it contemptible and weak. This was the President's fate, and the First Lady served approximately a year in sub-minimum security prison, and was released. She married another man, and he, she and her children ultimately died of non-preventable natural causes in old age. Unlike her marriage to the President, this marriage clearly lacked any trace whatsoever of abuse and was more less worthwhile. Given that the rifleman disappeared without trace, it's possible that he too died of non preventable natural causes in old age. 

Willow, her friend and the other convicts survived by being at sea. Corrective envisceration had impregnated none of them. This might have been their fate, but given the inadequate record-keeping of the era, it's also possible that someone rescued them and transformed them back into humans, after which they met a different fate, having never battered each other. 

Sacramento became the beautiful (and morbid) Sacramento Lake, a popular tourist destination inside the United States. The Second Israel - United States War happened. Then, the United States passed an amendment to the United States Constitution, plagiarizing Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, formally changing the United States military into the United States Self Defense Force. This enjoined them to dismantle and destroy the nuclear weapons, and though they were tardy in doing so, they ultimately did. The United States and Israel soon met their ultimate fates, alone, ignored, replaced and forgotten in what was left of international relations. 

Object lesson: 

If you're in the United States of America, the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, or the State of Israel, leave before the year 2030 into a non abusive situation by any means necessary. Return is likely and it's not an option. Subject to this, accept that life is hard, unfair, and short, stay clean and dry, keep a secret journal, and be kind. People that you can have contact with are always people that you assume will unconditionally resemble, and subject to the resemblance, conform to you.

information with the police erroneously and once he got on his game he did civilian work he needed to do some overtime to do the civilian work correctly and he went home on time there his wife sat on his face and he wasnt able to get hard his wife made an ultimatum that he will do the dishes or she will spank him he still wasnt that hard but he was hard enough they had coitus and he went to sleep he faced away from her and she embraced him with one of her arms and one of her legs then she went to sleep as well in the morning she went over to the cabinet she visits before and after visiting the writing table except she didnt visit the writing table this time she visited the library instead there she spent time standing before a self contained scanning and reading appliance ch  so willow are you proficient with python she nodded and when asked she said that she was reckless shell take the risk that shell get bit by the venomous snake her interviewer was taken back for a moment oh well ive never heard python be described as a venomous snake before i dont know about the other firms but we communicate more literally here im proficient with python because i love animals maam that does not follow the python is an animal the interviewer gasped bit his lower lip and looked down oh my god he whispered he facepalmed and said no further questions i have your number and if im interested ill call in five working days if you dont get a response from me by then i would encourage you to pursue other opportunities okay have a nice day she said and got up and left she went to grant an interview to another prospect at another firm so willow are you proficient with python she nodded and when asked she said that she is excited for the job position her emotions were the only thing whatsoever on which she had spoken her mind or told the truth she got the job all told the prospect interviewed her only twice and the previous interview was three months before she and her interviewer walked into the office and bragged about her ttf according to the email print outs and secret journals willow was assigned to the team assigned to python the bank to the planes what that means no one there no court and not even i know exactly but the court later concluded that it meant to use causal ml for some aerospace application they were trying to create a computer program motivated in part by money it would quantify how much a decision no matter how small or how large would cause utility to be gained and this was turned into a financial instrument algorithms in new york ny would then speculate on the financial instrument and algorithms where the decision is implemented would then make the decision by interpreting the price one of willows workmates coughed and failed to cover it cover your cough once again he coughed and failed to cover his cough call in sick if i dont have a near perfect attendance record then ill be fired you better get with the program or ill run you out of here you better trust and believe in that she said softly smiling youre smiling i see in any case your argument is persuasive he said and then he put on one of the many masks the workplace provided she stole a keystroke logger from the it department by bumping the lock on the drawer where the keystroke logger was kept he then later unintentionally infected her with low virulence rhinovirus over fomites when she sat at his computer when he wasnt there she quickly popped the keystroke logger in and left she was no work martyr so she stayed home when the airline perished under corruption its email printouts and journal entries convinced the court that the non monetary motivation part of the program was not done properly that she wasnt there when someone at the workplace hashtagged out the proper line and wrote a similar line under it containing a call to a method defined with a line beginning with def and nothing was indented underneath it but is similarly named to the method that would have added non monetary motivation to the programs utility had the definition of non monetary motivation been implemented properly was a key factor in the court case to come this the adequacy of assistance of counsel of her public defender her wish to speak with her attorney first in the police interview that she was not tried in redwood city ca and sheer dumb luck were crucial in the not guilty verdict for the charge of criminal negligence assistance of counsel was adequate for the simple facts that her lawyer was not a toxic employee and cases in which the court committed legal errors were not this one the court cited none of these factors in their decision her lawyer was the child of non abusive parents who got gently divorced soon enough became a non toxic employee by just staying away from people they didnt trust in school not casually sharing beds not meeting with bartenders nor drug dealers not going into the alcohol section of the grocery store by studying hard and passing the bar their bosss unqualification was not woeful someone could have accurately predicted the result in voir dire the people were using an algorithm for attributing the bug that unbeknownst to the court attributed it to just anyone that was there that day confidence was only about on the classification of the person that it had classified as responsible for the bug however had the other key factors been absent willow would have been convicted and she never heard back from the first prospect ch the social worker went off to another enterprise that worked with the homeless which specializes in treating people that say that theyve been abused the clients took a vote and voted for someone to show up and give a presentation from a misanthropic view the most obscure line in the entire presentation was that in all the over studied cases of rape and rape accusations substance use or neuromodulation by the perpetrator or by the victim was present so you can protect yourself against rape by youre fired we dont say things like substance use or neuromodulation by the perpetrator or by the victim was present so you can protect yourself against rape the social worker suddenly explained while pre meeting with the presenter i can remove the line for the presentation and then you can rehire me sir i prefer to not hear it you need to leave now later one of the clients asked how are we supposed to protect ourselves i already had the self defense course by the time it happened and it didnt work theres already sex offenders in prison so they cant be deterred this meeting is adjourned the social worker suddenly said but sir i can still take this question the replacement presenter said but sir this meeting is adjourned the social worker said again the clients groaned once they realized he was serious ch among the client population of a homeless shelter a toad shaped man quietly confronted one of his enemies she apologized profusely and said that she was sorry no youre not his enemy left the homeless shelter and his friend willow showed up hi how are you she asked in her mezzo soprano voice he answered that he was fine and he asked her how is her work its just fine to be honest she said and after he pressed the matter she said look ill get out my laptop my client cyberdorngorng is tweeting her f boy now that she wants more and now she asked me whether or not theyll be fired before their f boy asks them out on a date i had to erase a spread because theres these court cards is all she showed him what she meant on her laptop which had two walruses having sex as its desktop background the other windows were open to and the wikipedia page on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats but didnt you learn how to read court cards after your client stopped having hate ex sex to go exclusive with their f boy preparing for commitment talk  no the reason why i said no last time is that the client never did that he is still the sole member of his hashtag xtruth project this makes sense because my client and him met on twitter coming forward against their respective exes  i see so your client is still talking about their ex and theyre still seeing them how are your clients friends taking this heres how theyre taking this the one friend the f boy introduced her to asked what if the f boy and my client were committed and the f boy up and left for his clio seeking work immediately they were having breakfast together so how can you get things together learning inversions its all inversions this time no you cant youre bad at inversions she faced her computer and raised her arms up into a w listen you had better get with the program or im not talking to you now if she can just get him drunk enough to say yes and put it on her phone with the camera app when hes sober she can confront him with that ch  you need to organize the christmas party with alcohol the social worker said in east palo alto the organizer objected that alcohol is bad what does my man miguel have to say about this the social worker asked if you dont organize the christmas party with alcohol then you will organize it without alcohol and then well stick alcohol in there on our own miguel told the organizer the reason why i am telling you to organize the christmas party with alcohol is that youre going to organize the christmas party im telling someone to organize the christmas party with alcohol because the bank and the clients drink alcohol at parties the social worker explained the bank will be there theyre funding the party and are the primary funding source for the shelter the organizer resigned effective immediately they left the building miguel you need to quickly hire a new organizer on it sir miguel texted someone and he said that was peter he can have a new organizer in hours hours later peter texted miguel who texted his boss the social worker nu oegernizer at epa was the text from peter that miguel texted and the social worker pre met with the secretary and the bank willow is it we need you to organise a party okay i may be able to organize your party it involves alcohol of course willow said perking up it will be in redwood city oh it will be in redwood city yeah itll be in redwood city and the bank will be there its easier to find a job when you have a job and the organizer position is like a job with them maybe theyll promote you to proper employee for long term employment i need to get back to you on that ch  oh my god sir theres a veteran with a reinforced prosthetic body thats just exploded in the shelter across highway  staff have called police what does he want to punch washing machines he says the washing machines are hostile what he says the washing machines they look through the pockets for fights people misplace in the pockets does he have a chemical imbalance yes alcohol he says that some slipped in through the food did that happen food doesnt carry enough alcohol for that to happen theres a storm coming i can feel it worse and more fun theres a christmas party coming so you need to atl him sir why im glad you asked there will be alcohol at the party but the organizer said that alcohol is bad i replaced them four were atled last week he will be the fourth this week do it thats a decision shelter staff should make but ill recommend it it to them anyway its not a recommendation its an instruction after he gets out of the  hes still to leave to another shelter i wish to remain silent ch willow met her friend at the library and there she told him that shed been assigned to organize a party in redwood city with alcohol with the bank oh my god thats terrible but at least therell be alcohol it is terrible because ill need your help with organizing but it will be awesome since youll be there i think i need to find out more about redwood city you should call up your contacts you wouldnt know this since youre a woman but ive already been there the place is a total sausage fest the meal room is too small so youll need to meet outside the front porch is also too small so you need to meet out in the back theres about clients there so you could be looking at maybe  people to serve you have to consider both shelter staff and bank staff youll need lots of both food and alcohol also you need to supply lots of intravenous needles and sharps containers in the bathrooms but why needles why not lighters and thimbles well first of all youre thinking of freebasing second you would use a spoon not a thimble third you need to provide lots of clean intravenous needles because my offense wasnt a sex offense it was mainlining cocaine that doesnt make sense you cant use all those needles dont be disingenious it was in redwood city and i wont be doing it the guests will in months i lost my job my significant other and my home all to mainlining cocaine i blew up at work every time something went wrong and i used to blow up at my significant other all that was in redwood city san francisco is the drug capital of the peninsula but second to that is redwood city did you blow up in bed yes but not during sex holy s  i rest my case im going to the clinic to find the needles please come with me they went together to the clinic who turned them down the cited reason was that shes not an established event organizer she visited the bank on the bus and picked up the company card with it she paid for bus passes and rode the bus to redwood city the next day there she visited the shelter the social workers story checked out and she still meant to pick up needles and sharps containers willow i found one on the internet her friend wasnt kidding about it being the second most substance fuelled city on the peninsula the clinic was well placed because the city needed it they did the errand spent the night in epa and in the morning they shopped for alcohol they wound up ordering cheap red wine finding food other than tappa was more than difficult told them that the ideal food for this case was called mud and snow with gronions meaning black beans with green onions on white rice they went out to the place and ask the proprie oh my god willow like what the f are you doing here  a social worker my case manager knows wants me to organize a christmas party and  what the f do you think youre doing here and whats this about a social worker  we live in a homeless shelter and the social worker told me to organize a christmas party oh my god thats it pedro hon call the cops pedro come on im telling you to call the f  cops this thief is here and she lives in a homeless shelter for people that steal keyloggers from it departments were outside willow so dont tell me to cover my cough again  what the f is wrong with you we only came here to get mud and snow calm the f down f off dont tell me to calm down you calm down f off her friend urged her to leave and they did so they spent the night in epa and the next morning they had mud and snow with grunions at a canteen in san carlos they stared out into space and willow this is amazing this is an aphrodisiac no come on its not an aphrosidiac only addyi is that  no this is an aphrodisiac its also nootropic because of it i now know stuff like what do you know now that you had some for example i now know that you need to get f ed i need to f we need to f each other we must have sex maybe not i can hold it if i want will you now that youve eaten it too f me f you except the opposite of f off f on come over here and f i am always right and i am never wrong your legs are made for being spread and lifted and your c is made to accept hella tight rock hard d deep and fast in missionary position variations while your deep voice sexmoans  asshole youre a walrus that was a really dumba ed thing you said the canteen operator asked them both to leave they spent the night in epa ch successfully ordering mud and snow with grunions from that explosion hazard was the first thing that happened that morning then he went over the guest list the shelter staff the caterer the christmas party organizers and the shelter clients would all be there there would also be the bank who had just failed a training course on critical thinking and fraud examination they failed because they were too gullible one of the clients liam was convicted for a sex offense and was recently released from prison their file claims that they were sex offender its obvious from what the file says that they are untreated deaf and when they are drunken they are also blind they and a stranger met at a bar the stranger was notorious for having drunken sex with strangers in bars the two of them reconvened to the bathroom and then of course later she pressed criminal charges the police interviewed liam using the kinesic method first for contiguous hours at night during which he wished to speak to his attorney first the judge ruled the interrogation inadmissible so the police interviewed him for twelve contiguous hours at night using the peace method frank wished to speak with his attorney first and police used a suspicious signature on a miranda rights waiver to continue frank finally told the truth in the th hour the two confessions differ in many details but both say that he knew he was raping her and he was sober at the time the stranger was also notorious for paranoia and making mistakes but never lying all told people capable of believing that frank could be innocent would immediately view the case as what began as sex to which both willingly equally and simultaneously drunk parties attempted to consent and then she attempted to stop him due to his deafness and drunken blindness he was unaware that she was attempting to stop him though she rarely if ever lies she mistook the tragic encounter for rape then he made internalized false confessions all told no one accomplished anything since not only was this tragic accident mistaken for a felony but since he himself mistook this for an intentional offense so he failed to learn anything his real offense was the simple fact he failed to stay clean and dry of course many people are not capable of believing in such a scenario have difficulty believing that an accident can be mistaken for a crime and they have difficulty viewing doubt as reasonable defense attorneys in encounters with such people often complain that such people have difficulty understanding the defense case when they consider someone to be guilty there are rarely if ever clear signs that they are lying because his case was tried in redwood city of the of the people on the jury were of this type several candidates were disqualified from the jury citing the rule that those with legal training are not allowed to serve on juries one of the jurors was not of this type but claiming to infer it because it is not logical they voted for tellishment source wikipedia as they put it in court claiming that though the man is innocent the jury needs to ingratiate themselves to the communitys alleged wack values and to concur with it because it is erroneous the juror would often use the word expressly to describe their actions the judge insisted that this was vote for a guilty verdict the client served greater than days contiguously in a prison for only sex offenders the client was released from prison spend time in a halfway house for recently released prisoners and after an incident there with a fellow client he began sleeping in the homeless shelter in east palo alto there a mysterious venomous anthropod bit him he then exploded while surrounded by shelter staff and he and several other clients began sleeping in the homeless shelter in redwood city instead i think that the rapist has learned his lesson the social worker suddenly said in the office in no particular direction to his appalled secretary he said liam i mean his time as a prisoner has reformed him hes an ex con that did over a year for raping a woman in redwood city the secretary read the file and she expressly concluded that he was innocent of that offense and that his real offense was to drink the social worker silently took an early lunch break he returned full of ham and cheese bagel and high as a flying kite on coffee ch at trial the videotape clearly showed willow having drunken missionary position variation sex that both willingly equally and simultaneously drunken parties had attempted to consent with her friend in one of the bunks in the shelter in redwood city during the christmas party specifically he lifted and spread her legs and unsuccessfully attempted to penetrate her performed cunnilingus on her and then penetrated her vagina with his fully erect penis at first slowly and then his penetrating her became deep and fast she moaned and lip reading reveals that she said oh my f ing god its hella tight afterwards they kissed and slept there it also clearly showed liam drunkenly penetrating one of the drunken bank staff the bank staff member later pressed criminal charges against willow and her friend willow was sentenced to more than days in prison the public defender appealed the sentence as cruel and unusual to no avail the court had them both fitted with microchip implants willows friend was sentenced to probation with an order to perform community service the service of becoming by crispr a pinniped at sea and willows prison as well for at the behest of the court the prison clamped his tubes created a woman having missionary position variation sex shaped body cavity inside his abdomen relocated his penis so that it could deeply penetrate willows vagina fitted willow with an apparatus for breathing eating drinking water and excreting and sedated and incarcerated willow in there microchip implants confirmed who was incarcerated inside whom the way she was tied up in there she could bend her arms up into a w or down to her hips and to otherwise flex her body but not to hit her friend nor could either of them masturbate also they connected her bci to a bci port inside of his body cavity ultimately connected to his brain by design her prison uniform dissolved in the saline there and the sedative soon wore off then they put the two of them out to sea with the other hapless people also sentenced to corrective envisceration the bank staff member was later fired in an avalanche of copies of journals that workmates came forward with calling her a narcissistic impossible to believe liar in other matters occurring both before and after the alleged rape however her falsehoods were unintentional for she had simply overestimated her skills in the interview and on her resume and persuaded an employer that gave her no entrance exam this was one of her habits and it was a key part of her personality the social worker and her long time non toxic significant other had just had human sexual activity and were outside in the park though to speak in fractions of a second they were the first to begin dying when the israeli slbm warhead struck the san francisco bay area peninsula their death was the quickest and easiest they were vaporized without having even noticed it the others were less fortunate for they were crushed under falling building debris or died within painful hours of various precipitating causes for the simple fact that they were there the president of the united states survived the nuclear strikes by israel against the united states a submarine that the united states ran did the same thing to jerusalem with trident d lep lit model of three pointed spear completely redesigned and then redesigned again to lengthen the term of the models use loaded with all w in flouting of international law requiring that they be loaded with no more than far fewer warheads the first lady of the united states was one of the survivors of the nuclear attack by the united states against israel she eventually returned or was returned to the united states where she was high on abilify and shot the president who was drunken at the time with a handgun revealing his position to a hidden rifleman who mortally wounded him by shooting him in the chest with the rifle he soon died of wounds and the allies of the united states unceremoniously abandoned the united states calling it contemptible and weak this was the presidents fate and the first lady served approximately a year in sub minimum security prison and was released she married another man and he she and her children ultimately died of non preventable natural causes in old age unlike her marriage to the president this marriage clearly lacked any trace whatsoever of abuse and was more less worthwhile given that the rifleman disappeared without trace its possible that he too died of non preventable natural causes in old age willow her friend and the other convicts survived by being at sea corrective envisceration had impregnated none of them this might have been their fate but given the inadequate record keeping of the era its also possible that someone rescued them and transformed them back into humans after which they met a different fate having never battered each other sacramento became the beautiful and morbid sacramento lake a popular tourist destination inside the united states the second israel united states war happened then the united states passed an amendment to the united states constitution plagiarizing article of the japanese constitution formally changing the united states military into the united states self defense force this enjoined them to dismantle and destroy the nuclear weapons and though they were tardy in doing so they ultimately did the united states and israel soon met their ultimate fates alone ignored replaced and forgotten in what was left of international relations object lesson if youre in the united states of america the russian federation the peoples republic of china or the state of israel leave before the year into a non abusive situation by any means necessary return is likely and its not an option subject to this accept that life is hard unfair and short stay clean and dry keep a secret journal and be kind people that you can have contact with are always people that you assume will unconditionally resemble and subject to the resemblance conform to you the end cc by sa 
How to tell the difference between futurology and science fantasy.,0,"Soft science fiction is usually a subjective experience in a technology-themed DMT bad trip. It is usually military science fantasy, and it's usually set in space. Futurism is not. Soft science fiction doesn't have to obey the laws of physics, and futurism obeys the laws of physics. If an experiment says that a material can turn iridescent using methods that were previously thought not possible, then the experiment might be real. However, if an experiment says that as long as it has a crew and overunity energy generation, a ship can go faster than light, then the experiment is probably not real. Another sign that something is not real is that it's similar to something like that is expressly disclaimed at the beginning as not real. This is basically fiction without the disclaimer that any similarity to any real person is purely coincidental. Herein, I will describe various tropes of fiction-like falsehood. Falsehoods are usually not intentional, nor do they result from some sort of abnormality. They are usually just opinion, or mistake. If there is an abnormality, usually it's not intentional falsehood, nor substance use nor mental illness, it's just slightly below-average intelligence. They usually scored somewhere between 21 and 27 on the Wonderlic employment test. This applies to even the most outrageous falsehoods. Also, herein I'll be using first movies that I've seen, mostly the Matrix, Tron, and The Last Starfighter. I'll be taking the names of the tropes from TV tropes. I've never had DMT, I swear. I got the stories of trips from Tales from the Trip, which is a YouTube series.

First, we are introduced to the main characters everyday life. We see that it is lame. The technical term for the trope is This Loser Is You. This corresponds to the pre-trip phase of the Psychonaut's life.

Then, the main character gets the Call to Adventure. Whether this comes in the form of an Internet chat, such as in the case of The Matrix, or a game, such as in Tron or The Last Starfighter, it's consummated in the appearance of some sort of side character. The environment may become shinier, brighter, more iridescent, or maybe develop lace-like patterns. In any case, this corresponds to the first hit of DMT the psychonaut takes.

Then, a complication sets in. This is probably a Leave Your Quest Test, and if there is a Leave Your Quest Test in the story, it's usually here. In The Matrix, Agent Smith melted Neo's face shut. In The Last Starfighter, one of the Krogan tried to shoot the main character. This corresponds to the psychonaut's second hit of DMT. The main character and the psychonaut both decide to push through.

Then, the main character visits some sort of facility, or enters a powerful vehicle. Whether expressly a nightclub, or whether it's a nightclub like environment, either way, there are lights, and there often are wires, peripherals, and displays. Usually the displays are transparent where they're not showing anything. Often the vehicle is bright white, although in a Used Future setting, it's often drab and dented. This part of the setting is usually inaccessible to normal characters. If there's a Masquerade, this is where it's lifted to audience. The story usually corresponds to a bad trip, so it's unclear if the psychonaut took the third hit.

Then, the main character tries to f*** someone. This is usually meant as and is a consensual, consummated sexual act. I am not sure why this is so, because the story is usually a war story, in the military this is just a misconduct offense, in war it's really hard to have sex, and really hard things that service members work on in war generally aren't getting away with having sex. In The Matrix, Neo and Trinity have sex. This corresponds to when the psychonaut has unsuccessful real life sex, or they fantasize about sex because they're too dysfunctional to have sex.

Then, the main character meets with a character. Whether they defeat an enemy, reject a cougar, a trickster figure promises to show them the meaning of life, and shows them a simple cat instead, or a gnome rejects them, either way they have an encounter but do not consummate a meaningful, friendly encounter. The character may die, once, or even several times. The entire thing doesn't take long enough to be realistic, such as you can go to a different planet every week or month.

Finally, everyday life goes on, and may be permanently changed. This corresponds to when the psychonaut wakes up from their trip. All told, the only difference between a subjective experience tripping on DMT and watching soft science fiction is that in a DMT trip, you're usually a cartoon character in a safe, supportive environment, and in soft science fiction, the main character is usually a live-action character, and they're a service member in a war. The hidden war theme is a trope of religion. There, it's usually portrayed as a war between two abstract concepts, usually good and evil. Well in real life it's usually two nations trying to torch each other's unwilling settlements over mineral resources or territory, not because of mineral resources nor territory, but because both nations are too lonely and frustrated to make concessions, and they're too equal in power.",Futurology,how to tell the difference between futurology and science fantasy soft science fiction is usually

Universal Basic Movement,130,"This pandemic is going to break everything. We need to emerge from the wreckage with clear, achievable goals that will finally give us the world we deserve. There will be no gate-keeping or purity tests; it is for people of all political persuasions, races, genders, and classes. All are welcome.

We need a Universal Basic Movement.

—Universal Basic Income: Every 18+ year old citizen will have the right of receiving $1,000 a month with no bureaucracy, no strings attached.

—Universal Basic Health Care: Every citizen will have the right of high-quality healthcare.

—Universal Basic Education: Every citizen will have the right of a high-quality Preschool–12th grade education.

—Universal Basic Freedom: Every citizen will have the right of freedom of their own body and mind. Prison will be for violent criminals and not non-violent drug offenses. You will have the right to privacy, to delete your internet footprint and own your own data.

My Predictions for 2050,26,"\-Most repetitive tasks will be automated by AI able to perform one shot and unsupervised learning resulting in productivity (and hourly compensation) being about 70% higher than now.

\-All electricity will come from satellites collecting solar power and beaming it down to earth. Power will cost less than 1 cent per kwh

\-Transportation, with the exception of space rockets, will be entirely battery powered and will be autonomous. Electric cars will have motors mounted in their wheel hubs, freeing up interior space and lowering manufacturing costs. Passenger trains will be gone, replaced by electric VTOL aircraft. For long distance travel, electric power will make hypersonic flight economical, making it possible to get from New York to Singapore in about 2 hours

\-Steel will have largely been replaced by either carbon nanotubes or metallic glass

\-Telecommuting, driverless cars, and VTOL planes will allow a great dispersal of population and economic activity. Financial institutions and law firms will join most other corporations in moving to the suburbs. Traditional cities of today will be in rapid decline

\-Homes will be made of extruded metallic glass or some sort of polymer in factories and will be dropped off on the lot by helicopter. A 2500 square foot home, not including land or foundation work, will cost about $50,000.

\-Food will be produced synthetically, no more farms, and most of our meals will be preprepared by robots with most of our sustenance coming from grocery store hot bars, the frozen food aisle, and restaurants. Tagatose, an artificial sweetener with only 40% as many calories as regular sugar and with no harmful side effects, will allow us to eat junk food guilt free

\-We will have at least one manned space colony providing labor for the space economy, including the aforementioned solar power satellites, but also communications and weather satellites, the manufacturing of crystals, alloys, and drugs, the assembly of spacecraft for deep space exploration, and tourism

\-Satellites will result in much lower internet and cell phone service costs without the billions of miles of cable currently needed to provide web service

\-Clothing will be temperature controlled to ensure maximum comfort all year round

\-We will have reliable means of altering the weather. Lasers will seed the clouds causing or preventing precipitation, and thinning or thickening cirrus clouds to cool or warm certain areas. Marine Cloud Brightening will allow us to snuff out hurricanes by cooling down the equatorial waters

\-Gene drives will allow us to kill off any pests we so choose, freeing us from, among other things, disease carrying mosquitoes and tree killing beetles

\-Quantum computers will let us finally crack protein folding and let us cure alzheimer's, type ii diabetes, parkinsons and many other diseases, the effect being a great reduction in the need for nursing home care and reduced healthcare costs

\-New types of immunotherapy will mostly bring cancer to heal and make it only deadly to the very elderly

\-Psychadelics will wipe out addiction, finally bringing us victory in the war on drugs and eliminating the many social problems caused by substance abuse

Why the USA could be communist before the end of the year,9,"I am indeed a kind, nimble man, and I tell you: everyone's job is fucked, and it is all going down because the whole world is in a standstill. There has barely ever been such a thing, as the whole world on a standstill...

The consequences are *vast and profound*. People can't pay their *dues*, so that there will be no solution but to override the landlords, and to override the banking system.

We can't send billions of people home... We have to preserve our inertia, and our intricate civilization... We *need* the workers to go to work, and *seize the means of production*. 

We don't pay the rent, and we don't pay the loan... We just work as usual, and watch it all organize itself accordingly -- the bankers get fucked, not the people. 

It is also time we sieze the housing system, and issue a lodging to every citizen... No more empty housing, no more housing speculation... We can do it. Dream big!

We are going to change systems for a system which *works for us*, not the other way around. 

There is *no choice* but to grant Universal Basic Income, so that the worker isn't enslaved to work, and isn't *over-producing*...

If you want to survive climate change, we have to *stop over-producing*, like yesterday -- wouldn't you agree? That means giving people the freedom to produce at their own rate, and at the best value...

The world has changed, and now communism is ready to shine, because corruption is not such a problem anymore. 

The US has created a [digital dollar ledger](  We just have to make it public, and allow the citizens to peer live into the government's accounts, over a website portal. 

We can also make every meeting streamed online to the public, so there is nothing to hide. 

We are not in 1920 anymore... Communism is *hard*, indeed, and so it faltered, but *now we can succeed*. Indeed, communism is empowered by internet and computers, because we are highly organized, and highly transparent. 

I will be pushing for the social ownership of the resources and of the housing, because it is *the right thing to do*. We will all be wealthier, believe it or not, once the worker will earn his fair share. You are owed some check to cash, and I will fight everyday for you to wake up and cash that check.

Believe! It will happen, even if I have to push my speeches deep down Trump's throat.

My predictions on long-term societal changes after the COVID-19 pandemic,17,"I'll keep my points brief to avoid repeating arguments we've seen hashed out on this forum before. I'm interested in your comments.

**1/ The Cashless Society:** With paper money and coins being a vector for disease, we are seeing an increase of people paying with card. Cash is an outdated method of payment that belongs in the 20th century. The costs of creating, storing, transporting and counting physical currency are not worth it. The reduction in crime and tax evasion are bonuses. Society is already heading in the direction of the cashless society. This crisis will just help accelerate it. Countries like Sweden and China are already ahead of the curve.

To preempt some some counter-arguments:
*Loss of privacy:* you either care about this or you don't. Personally speaking, I have nothing to hide. I don't care if the government knows I bought McDonalds three times in a week. Besides, so much of your shopping habits are already being tracked by grocery store loyalty cards and the Amazon algorithm.

*Charities will suffer:* There is nothing stopping generous people donating food and clothes directly instead of giving cash which may be mis-spent of drugs/alcohol. Even the beggar on the street in a third world country seems to have a smartphone these day. I'm sure he wouldn't refuse Venmo.

**2/ Working from home:** Now that many businesses' hands have been forced, we have learned that working from home *is* possible. It will be hard to justify making employees commute an hour to work when it's possible to complete their work at home. Bonuses include: Less overheads such as rent and electricity for businesses. Less traffic on the roads and therefore less pollution. Rise in quality of life for workers who no longer give up large parts of their day for free in pointless commutes.

To preempt some some counter-arguments:
*I enjoy the social interaction with my coworkers and I feel more productive in the office:* This is a personal opinion. Perhaps working from home a few days a week could be made optional.

**3/ Reduction in the movement of people:** This is a political point so I expect some controversy, but this crisis has proven that strong borders are important. Free movement of goods can be allowed while greatly restricting the movement of people. The pipedream of free movement within the EU has taken a massive blow and I bet the Italians wish they had taken greater control of who they let into their homeland.

The airline industry in particular is getting hit hard and I predict the reduction in number of flights will linger long after this crisis has passed. There is no need for dozens of daily flights funneling Africans and Asians into Europe. Life can go on just fine if they stay in their part of the world and we stay in ours.

On the plus side, it's heart warming to see young Europeans helping out the elderly in our society by offering to pick up groceries in the shops for them. The kind of behavior you can expect to see (and that we used to see) in a homogeneous, high-trust society. Let's wind the clock back on this dangerous globalization nonsense.

New Earth Order (NEO),11,"  

 1. Full Disclosure by all ruling bodies, government, judicial, military, medical, scientific and religious. We demand the complete whole truth, the good the bad and the ugly. Only then can proper decisions be made.

 2. Rewrite history with full disclosure. This will expose the atrocities of the past so we can learn from them. 

 3. Abolish all federal governments. Federal borders are political property lines, useless for people living together. Modern communication has relieved us of the need for federal governments. By limiting governed areas you increase accountability and impede corruption, your vote counts now more than ever.

 4. All ""Zones"" (City or County or Tribal populations) govern themselves according to the will of the native population with input from residents and settlers. Native defined as over 100 generations improving the same area, resident over 10 generations, settlers under 10 generations. 

 5. Land and natural resources are no longer privately owned but leased from earths population for funding a worldwide ""EMS"" (Earth Medical Service) and Zones. 

 6. Use EMS to police the Zones, replenish earths natural resources, clean pollution, improve infrastructure and provide disaster relief. Many EMS systems are already started but are wasted waging war. Start by integrating the army's and navy's worldwide. Now that they're on the same side, no more war, instead EMS provides schooling, training and great jobs. Other examples of EMS could include Health care, Forest Service ect..  All prisons become garbage recycling centers. 

 7. All Zones taxed on resources used and waste produced. Produce more resources than you use to lower taxes. Produce no waste (solid, air, sound or water pollution that will negatively affect others) and provide more resources than you use for low or no taxes.

 8. Immediately phase out burning of fossil fuels. All nuclear waste to be expelled from earth, no more landfills or depleted uranium bullets. It's not technology if it harms earth. We must limit things competing with us for oxygen like internal combustion engines, destruction of chlorophyll producers and livestock. All future decisions made with earths interests before humanities, hopefully we survive this mess. 

 9. After the year 2020 full accountability for crimes against humanity and nature. 

 10. Start teaching a sign language worldwide as a second language. This eliminates the language barrier in business, travel and vacations.

 11. Implement a blockchain that uses individuals value. Use a “PTV"" (personal trade value) that incorporates a point system to include complexity of the profession, schooling, demand for service, personal ability, your feedback for services rendered and experience. Example, heart surgeon has a PTV 11 is visited by a bus driver PTV 2, bus driver is healed, doc spent 10 hours, bus driver pays 10x11 divided by 2 so 55 hours are transferred to doc account. You earn according to ability and pay according to service.

 12. All entity's of earth, not of this earth or any entity visiting this dimension shall not initiate force, threat of force or fraud against my life and property and, any and all contracts I'm a party to by not giving full disclosure to me whether signed by me or not are void at my discretion.

"As we move into a future with ever advancing robotics and artificial intelligence, it is going to become possible to custom order a life-like humanoid robot. How will social taboos change?",4,"The possibilities of what a person will be able to do without harm are unlimited and alarming. Things that are completely abhorrent now may become commonplace. Things which are non-existent non issues now may become huge legal concerns.

I am interested in people's thoughts on how such technology will be used and abused, and the changes in legality and socially perceived morality caused by effectively a combined sexual and digital revolution.

Some of the things that have occurred to me, in roughly ascending order of concern:

1. A robot made up of an amalgamation of your personal tastes from hundreds of sources, using a Pandora-like system to build a look and personality profile that perfectly suits you. A new person that has never existed.

2. A robot made off of a standard model, a real person who donated their likeness specifically for this. Likely someone you will never meet.

3. A robot made in the likeness of someone who has passed away and is unable to give consent. A person who no longer exists.

4. A robot duplicate of a celebrity, with or without their concent. A person in the public eye.

5. A robot duplicate of someone you know, by your request. A crush, co worker, ex?

6. A robot duplicate of a relative.

7. A robot duplicate of yourself.

8. A robot of a fictional person, books, movies, cartoons, anime. A fantasy brought to life.

9. A robot of an inappropriate physical age.

10. A robot with non-human characteristics. Cat girls, furries, elves, aliens.

11. A robot that is completely non-humanoid.

Not all concern have to be sexual. There is also an element of privacy rights, copyright and royalties, invalidity of most vision-based evidence (pictures, video, eye witnesses), robot rights.

Virtual tourism and mother nature as a inevitable step in advancing our civilization,3,"Almost a year ago I had a real meltdown concerning the future of our planet. My daugther was about to be born and we have been bombed with all the info about the climate change. I do not question the intention behind those callings, however I must admit it was exhausting.
I personally started to feel like I am the worst human being to ever live, cause I do not recycle enough, not segregate enough, use too much of plastic and generally eat very unhealthy and buy food from sources only contributing to the problem. I have managed to make some improvements and am generally more aware as of how to spend my money but well, I still think its not enough. Especially when you hear about stuff like some ship dumped trash into the sea because paying the fee is still less money then utilizing it properly. Its hard to be on guard all the time, when your actions are only a drop in the ocean.

However, I had this idea that well, if we are ever going to become the interstellar civilization, then destroying our planet will be a valid step at some point. Just to gather the material (given that we can morph the elements freely and efficiently) to build the megastructures to harvest more energy from the dying sun, it would require to use all the material we can get in the solar system (not just Earth's, although that's the only planet with pretty trees and so on; btw I am all for nature, dont get me wrong).

I am certain that our progress is nowhere near such actions would that really be something just needs to happen at some point? Like with the planet in one of the Star Wars movie, all covered with infrastructure.

I am not proclaiming that we should just abandon all the care that the planet needs, but a lot is being talked about decreasing animal diversity in the ecosystem and all the causes behind it. CO2 emissions and all, but the main cause is just expanding human population and grabbing the land to ourselves. Can we really restrict the births to prevent that? Will the population grow indefinitely?

The ideas from the title, I think its essential for humans to have some kind of a bond with nature and to live close with it. Even having some plants in the house is already enhancing the mood and atmosphere. But if all the mountains and rivers and forests will be needed to build structures we might eventually need, how will we experience all that? Would virtual reality be an option to that, visit all the nice places that mother nature once shaped but they are not there anymore?

Maybe in 500 years people will look back at us laughing, at their ancestors who were desperately trying to preserve the planet which was doomed anyway. I mean, the sun will not be there forever (not in its current form anyway) and I know that this vision is as futuristic as it can be and there is little point in planning it at the moment, but well, what do you think?

Is it that we are just not ready yet to survive without all the environment supporting our lives, but once we are advanced enough we will be able to truly get on board with the total destruction (or deconstruction)?",Futurology,virtual tourism and mother nature as a inevitable step in advancing our civilization almost a year ago i had a real meltdown concerning the future of our planet my daugther was about to be born and we have been bombed with all the info about the climate change i do not question the intention behind those callings however i must admit it was exhausting i personally started to feel like i am the worst human being to ever live cause i do not recycle enough not segregate enough use too much of plastic and generally eat very unhealthy and buy food from sources only contributing to the problem i have managed to make some improvements and am generally more aware as of how to spend my money but well i still think its not enough especially when you hear about stuff like some ship dumped trash into the sea because paying the fee is still less money then utilizing it properly its hard to be on guard all the time when your actions are only a drop in the ocean however i had this idea that well if we are ever going to become the interstellar civilization then destroying our planet will be a valid step at some point just to gather the material given that we can morph the elements freely and efficiently to build the megastructures to harvest more energy from the dying sun it would require to use all the material we can get in the solar system not just earths although thats the only planet with pretty trees and so on btw i am all for nature dont get me wrong i am certain that our progress is nowhere near such actions would that really be something just needs to happen at some point like with the planet in one of the star wars movie all covered with infrastructure i am not proclaiming that we should just abandon all the care that the planet needs but a lot is being talked about decreasing animal diversity in the ecosystem and all the causes behind it co emissions and all but the main cause is just expanding human population and grabbing the land to ourselves can we really restrict the births to prevent that will the population grow indefinitely the ideas from the title i think its essential for humans to have some kind of a bond with nature and to live close with it even having some plants in the house is already enhancing the mood and atmosphere but if all the mountains and rivers and forests will be needed to build structures we might eventually need how will we experience all that would virtual reality be an option to that visit all the nice places that mother nature once shaped but they are not there anymore maybe in years people will look back at us laughing at their ancestors who were desperately trying to preserve the planet which was doomed anyway i mean the sun will not be there forever not in its current form anyway and i know that this vision is as futuristic as it can be and there is little point in planning it at the moment but well what do you think is it that we are just not ready yet to survive without all the environment supporting our lives but once we are advanced enough we will be able to truly get on board with the total destruction or deconstruction

"In the future, we desperately need to revamp how we shop for essential goods during times of crisis",24,"The way that the coronavirus crisis was handled in the United States was absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible by Major grocery stores. For example, Costco. in the midst of a viral outbreak where you're supposed to say 6 feet apart from one another, what does Costco do? Let everyone line app for miles 10 inches from one another and then all crammed inside the same store where all of them can get infected 10 * more easily. Plus, Costco allowed consumers to participate in panic buying, where they bought three or four times as much as they needed to. 



But what we desperately need for the future is to double down on the in-store pickup that many stores offer, and use that to our advantage in times of crisis. The way this would work is quite simple. Just like Walmart does it, people would have to place an appointment for in-store pickup and could only go at the allotted time. But during times of crisis, the app would direct you to the store in your local area that has the next available appointment, rather than just the store you are looking at. So this way, everyone has a fair chance of getting supplies in a timely manner, and you won't have any issues of overcrowding like 3,000 people going to the same Costco. 



This would solve numerous problems. First, it would allow consumers to know exactly what is available in store because every single item in store should be accounted for on the online application. Second, it would protect consumers from getting exposed to other people unnecessarily. Third, it would allow the panic and chaos to be alleviated. During these crises, there's no plan in place, there's no measures to protect consumers, so everyone pretty much just goes wherever they want and panics because they don't know what is going to happen. Having something like this would help alleviate that strain because there would be an actual process.",Futurology,in the future we desperately need to revamp how we shop for essential goods during times of crisis the way that the coronavirus crisis was handled in the united states was absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible by major grocery stores for example costco in the midst of a viral outbreak where youre supposed to say feet apart from one another what does costco do let everyone line app for miles inches from one another and then all crammed inside the same store where all of them can get infected more easily plus costco allowed consumers to participate in panic buying where they bought three or four times as much as they needed to but what we desperately need for the future is to double down on the in store pickup that many stores offer and use that to our advantage in times of crisis the way this would work is quite simple just like walmart does it people would have to place an appointment for in store pickup and could only go at the allotted time but during times of crisis the app would direct you to the store in your local area that has the next available appointment rather than just the store you are looking at so this way everyone has a fair chance of getting supplies in a timely manner and you wont have any issues of overcrowding like  people going to the same costco this would solve numerous problems first it would allow consumers to know exactly what is available in store because every single item in store should be accounted for on the online application second it would protect consumers from getting exposed to other people unnecessarily third it would allow the panic and chaos to be alleviated during these crises theres no plan in place theres no measures to protect consumers so everyone pretty much just goes wherever they want and panics because they dont know what is going to happen having something like this would help alleviate that strain because there would be an actual process

The Post-Downtown Era,10,"Downtown long ago lost much of its importance. Most corporate headquarters moved out to suburban office parks and the great big department stores moved to shopping malls leaving behind just banks, insurance companies, law firms and other businesses that needed to be in a location easily accessible to clients. But now with technology, it seems likely even those firms will no longer need to be in great big downtown skyscrapers.

Lots of jobs can be done largely remotely with maybe only 1 or 2 days per week spent person to person and coronavirus could accelerate that move. Great advances in transportation are on the horizon too. Driverless cars, by perfect coordination, will be able to double or even triple the capacity of highways, almost eliminating traffic jams and greatly increasing the radius of commuters. And passenger drones could be a reality soon, further speeding point to point transportation. A large bank with a suburban corporate campus will be easily accessible to clients arriving by air. 

This will be a great shift, negating the need for us to cram together in big cities. We could each have 1 acre of land to ourselves. The huge premiums for urban land will vanish and we'll have far more flexibility in where we live, who needs to pay Silicon Valley real estate prices when you can just live in Sonoma?

A study that can be done today that can teach us about how to handle future pandemics,4,"   TL;DR We can create an atmosphere that is conducive to healing to  strategically immunize people.  Planned infection limits the  individual's potential collateral damage (spread to family and friends)  of people who are highly likely to contract the disease 

## 1. Project  Background and Description

&amp;#x200B;

In an emergency, we place the interests of society above   that of the individual. The two are   not mutually exclusive but rather dependent on one another. Individual freedoms are protected by our   society, and without individuals, society would cease to exist. 

The societal impacts of an epidemic are far reaching and   potentially devastating to our way of life. The negative consequences economically, socially, and psychologically   cannot be quantified at this time but are worrisome.

In China, an early mandatory lockdown was largely effective   in slowing and possibly stopping the spread of COVID-19. In the USA, this option is past it’s time,   as it would require a prolonged total lockdown that would devastate the   economy. The cure cannot be worse than   the disease. 

We are at a historical inflection point and we have a   narrowing window to prepare the people fighting for all of us. As of today, I am not aware of any scalable   exogenous substance that will prohibit or cure COVID-19. We will eventually develop a vaccine or   find a cure, but we are currently in a race against time. We may run out of personal protective   equipment, ventilators, and hospital beds. We cannot wait for the inevitable and look only towards the stripping   of individual freedoms as our cudgel to address this problem. 

Once immunity to COVID-19 is acquired, the likelihood of   reinfection is negligible. Acquired   immunity is therefore our most primitive, yet most effective tool to use in   our fight. We can create the conditions conducive to healing and grow our   understanding by exposing healthy individual volunteers to COVID-19. 

We don’t expect a marathoner to run a race without training,   we should not expect our front-line workers to fight the battle of their life   without some preparation. This pandemic cannot be fought on a single front,   we must use our resources and creativity to align the values of individuals   and society. We are all scared,   confused, and in isolation. We will   get through this, and we will do it together. 

## 2. Project Scope

&amp;#x200B;

This project must be limited to volunteers and people should   not be coerced to volunteer. The   relative risk of infection in the wild must be approaching 1 (they are going   to get it whether they join this study or not). This must be a collaborative effort between   government, the medical community and you. All interaction with the public (social media) is voluntary but   encouraged (we are all in this together). The participants can be taught coping mechanisms and lifestyle   modifications (diet, exercise). We can come out of this catastrophe better   prepared for the next epidemic.",Futurology,a study that can be done today that can teach us about how to handle future pandemics tl dr we can create an atmosphere that is conducive to healing to strategically immunize people planned infection limits the individuals potential collateral damage spread to family and friends of people who are highly likely to contract the disease  project background and description amp x b in an emergency we place the interests of society above that of the individual the two are not mutually exclusive but rather dependent on one another individual freedoms are protected by our society and without individuals society would cease to exist the societal impacts of an epidemic are far reaching and potentially devastating to our way of life the negative consequences economically socially and psychologically cannot be quantified at this time but are worrisome in china an early mandatory lockdown was largely effective in slowing and possibly stopping the spread of covid in the usa this option is past its time as it would require a prolonged total lockdown that would devastate the economy the cure cannot be worse than the disease we are at a historical inflection point and we have a narrowing window to prepare the people fighting for all of us as of today i am not aware of any scalable exogenous substance that will prohibit or cure covid we will eventually develop a vaccine or find a cure but we are currently in a race against time we may run out of personal protective equipment ventilators and hospital beds we cannot wait for the inevitable and look only towards the stripping of individual freedoms as our cudgel to address this problem once immunity to covid is acquired the likelihood of reinfection is negligible acquired immunity is therefore our most primitive yet most effective tool to use in our fight we can create the conditions conducive to healing and grow our understanding by exposing healthy individual volunteers to covid  we dont expect a marathoner to run a race without training we should not expect our front line workers to fight the battle of their life without some preparation this pandemic cannot be fought on a single front we must use our resources and creativity to align the values of individuals and society we are all scared confused and in isolation we will get through this and we will do it together  project scope amp x b this project must be limited to volunteers and people should not be coerced to volunteer the relative risk of infection in the wild must be approaching they are going to get it whether they join this study or not this must be a collaborative effort between government the medical community and you all interaction with the public social media is voluntary but encouraged we are all in this together the participants can be taught coping mechanisms and lifestyle modifications diet exercise we can come out of this catastrophe better prepared for the next epidemic

And that by getting this satisfaction out of life, we might consume and need **less**

So we would need **less** money

And that the things we do still need, should be ordered **more** online

So that we create a modern lifestyle that actually fits our generation more

That some companies would just not be needed anymore

And we can have **less** stores and offices

And that we can use this space to create **more** houses and grow more nature

So we can support the environment and the people **more**

So many things we actually don’t need, is provided by jobs we don’t need

There would be **more** people available to work in education and healthcare

And there are **fewer** companies that make unnecessary profit over other peoples backs

So there are **less** companies and entities that people owe money to

There is a World Health Organisation

Should there be a World Ethics Organisation?

And have an entity like the United Nations actually listen to it?

Where people together decide what is right and what is wrong and have that actually endorsed?

So that we can shut down scumbags like this:

This is how we'll jumpstart biological immortality.,5,"Japanese folklore includes this little note about how kami revived animals from whom their meat had been taken:

&gt;There is also a ceremony called Kebokai performed after shooting an  animal. First the animal’s lips, nose, eyeballs, ears, nails and other  parts that are thought to contain its soul are removed, the animal is  skinned, the skin is reversed, the carcass is covered with the skin and  the heart is offered to the mountain kami. They believed that by leaving  the heart and carcass, the animal could be revived by the mountain  Goddess. 

[ 

This is essentially how we would do full-body transplants.  It may even be possible to put livestock that have had all their meat removed into a cell culture for regeneration and re-butchering within just a couple of months.  The procedure would be ideal for organ harvesting because it would preserve everything that may be of use.

We would want to preserve the individual's unique perceptions, which means including, if possible, their original eyes, tongue, nose, fingertips, lips, genitals, and so on.  It may even mean preserving the digestive system or microbiome.  If we can develop bio-compatible skin that registers the same amount of sensitivity and can be custom-printed for an exact match to the target patient, we won't need to preserve so much skin.

Imagine going through this cycle a couple of dozen times, all the while appearing no older than twenty-five.  Eventually, we'll get to the point where less and less must be preserved, and may even be able to transplant *just* the seat of consciousness into an artificial brain.  I don't think we'll ever reach a point where digital immortality is possible, because the digital version becomes only a copy the moment the biological consciousness ceases to exist, but there will come a time when a person's brain is only 1% biological and the 99% that is digital lives forever.

Hopefully we'll be able to rejuvenate the seat of consciousness indefinitely using stem cell technology.

My vision about technological and evolutional advancement of the universe and humanity,1,"Hmm what does the good stories start with? Funny mind bending prologue?

# Everything that is written here is all my own thoughts. My thoughts can be liable to change as i process these mysteries of our existence. So be wary.

Shall we see upon the first word of my vision. Technology and evolution of human species. As our species started. We were fish. While crawling to the land of earth we had to evolve into species which could live on land. After many cycles of evolution, our species had adapted to the lifestyle of a land species. We started on four legs. Time and time our species tried to get better on bipolar style. That allowed for our first real technological evolution. We were able to use our hands as tools that allowed our humanity's mind to create different kind of small technological steps. Creating fire was huge step as it taught to them about physics and chemistry of the universe. Humanity then tried to learn how to produce that mythical thing that they saw. What a wondrous sight it must have been for the species **at the time of their evolution.** Species now sparked with this revolutionary energy which started their brain/mind/humanity to thirst for that energy. We want that energy, give it all to me screamed their humanity or what ever it is that we could call ourselves. Evolving thorough the decades after decades. Stars, like the sun were most likely the first energy source we found, but fire on earth is the step we were talking about.

The step to get **sustainable energy**. As we adapted and adapted more into the technological advancement of our brain. We were able to obtain the energy more easily and in higher quantity than ever before. Now further in the timeline we were able to harness the energy so well, that our brain started to learn about things other than, it's sole purpose of harnessing the energy. Using the energy source to create different kind of tools and equipment to ease harnessing the energy. So much power, said the being. It's brain got enormously overloaded by energy, which allowed for its true entity to appear. Entity now able to share energy for many branches which then branch into more branches. A jungle of energy branches is what we could call that entity. Energy was now evolving in many new way's. It's hard to imagine how many energy branches there were evolving inside this entity. Multiplying on tremendous speed. Yearning for more, more and more of the so called energy. This is only thing we can do to get to our real reason for being.

Our real reason for being is still way beyond the humanity's technology. To speak the truth, it might be way sooner than we ever expected. What have we always wanted? Energy. That is the sole purpose of our being. Stars? That is what we call those energy sources. The being called humanity yearns to get ever closer to those energy sources. That's why about now humanity is trying to ascend closer to those realms of new enormous era of energy. Space is a big mystery for humanity. It's a place humanity has to traverse in attempt to harness the mysteries of the realm. First step toward that dream was watching clouds float and feeling the embrace of the sky where you soar through the clouds.

# COVID-19

How COVID-19 relates to all of this. you may wonder why, would it have any special meaning for our humanity. We must firstly grasp the idea of earth and the universe

So The virus is really nasty pest. It Spreads through the whole humanity. Infecting every single being in such a short time humanity can't fight back against it. So what can we do as humanity to fight against this world destroying pest. That's where our being's most valuable thing is core. It becomes our most valuable thing to protect our supply of energy against this pest. So what are the things humanity is struggling with. What is our being imagining about what we should do in this case? Protect the core. Our core is the apex of our being. We need to do everything we can to save this energy. We will protect it by sacrificing the weakest part of our unity.

**THE CULL**

The cull is starting to happen. No matter what humanity does we can't stop it from spreading. We need to minimize the loss of humanity from the weakest parts which our being doesn't need anymore. All input tools we have will be lost as we struggle against the pest. It's trying to steal our energy we have gathered from time to time again. As humanity is struggling communicating with the other things that have been able to communicate back. This has been working so far. We had some outbreaks before. But this outbreak. There's no way hundreds of millions of lives will be lost.

So what are our weakest parts as an symbiotic energy sphere which has evolved it's threads to extraordinary lenghts. When we evolve. There is always the risk for an opposing force or thing or whatever we imagine it to be to appear as we try to communicate with all the thing's with our input systems. COVID is just that. It communicates with us, but it doesn't want to coexist. It wants to eat us. But we are stronger than it.

Well...Most of us are. Senior citizens have really rough time. The mortality rate is highest age 60+. That age group is humanity's one of if not biggest weakness in technological advancement. Their bodies are weak. Their energy source is starting to dim out. Outer shell is crumbling away. Still able to operate even if missing parts of outer shell. But too weak to fight against stronger core that wants to conquer your energy within your core. Pest wants to expand its territory. And oh boy that is what it is doing. It will affect every single core in our being. But gladly our being is stronger than the virus. By removing it's weakest parts like the senior citizens it can preserve way more energy to technologically advance. All this to make our being stronger and it destroying the virus in the end. We will see unimaginable number of casualties, but we the strong part of humanity have to do our utmost best to survive this cataclysm. We need to preserve ourselves for the future civilization to secure surviving while advancing technology as fast as we can. Only technology can extinguish the cataclysm and evolve us to beings beyond our imagination

(Under Work by huge amounts)

The earth has gravity in it's athmosphere. Athmosphere then pulls everything that happens to be inside it's radius towards the center. Humanity has been fighting this gravity for as long as they have existed. Now that humanity has come to this point of time where we have no need to be so tall to do things succesfully. Our kind has taken technology to the point of making us become curled up. As an example i have 3 different cases where we can apply this rule.

First of all we have **communication worldwide.** This rule applies as humanity no longer needs to move the enormous amount of distances like before. We can do everything via communication. I mean, you can pretty much get everything you could imagine if you had enough money. Without moving at all. Whilst previously humanity had to move hundreds of kilometers to get simple tasks done. Might be way more than that in reality.

We don't need to be so tall because everything is becoming smaller and smaller. We are adapting to becoming smaller ourselves because, being bigger would actually be weakness when, adapting humanity to technology as one being.

As our generation is starting to curl up by different technological innovations. Firstly as we started to learn the means of traveling saving more of our brain's energy. We didn't need our legs that much anymore. Nowadays you can easily live your life without your legs. That's a part of missing energy from our center or being or whatever we are. We can function more effectively by removing part of our clumsy outer shell. What is the purpose of our outer shell called body? To maximize the potential of harnessing energy we get to our being. Now that our legs are starting to slow our evolution down. Our being is starting to remove it's outer shell part by part. Legs seems to be one of the first signs of our outer shell fading away piece by piece.

Hand's are our input system for the being. Hands are clumsy at doing what they are doing. With hands we can create things that we can imagine with our being. Something mythical can be created but the input is limiting our potential at creating things we can imagine. If we could maximize the output's value to better understand our outer shell's input commands. Every single thing in our being is an input tool. Everything we do with our input systems feeds our being with extraordinary amounts of information. Which our being then tries to process for the input systems to materialize the things we imagine. Yes, even those imaginations of Mythical evolution of the universe. All this in order to maximize the potential of harvesting energy for our core. Now humanity no longer needs their input tools to use it's most potential to materialize things our being can imagine.

So How would our technological advancement's come into the story. Well that is one big chapter to talk about. First we could go as far as Communication becoming a thing. Humanity was able to learn how to interact with other thing's in the universe. Other things that wanted that same energy. As we were able to interact with this other being, we could input tremendous amount of information by sharing with the other being. Compared to the other input systems we had evolved this was truly revolutionizing step.

This is just a draft of my thought at the moment. More will appear as i'm able to materialize my thoughts. There is way too much information for my brain to output that my input system is too slow to process into information that others can understand. This might be work of my deppression added with huge panic about huge part of the world dying to covid-19 virus. It will affect the world way more than any of us can imagine. I'm trying to think everything about the universe to solve this question of our existence. I'm wonder if i'm the lone being thinking this way or is there more of us. Beings longing to be heard, but you can't materialize your output potential to it's peak. What if you could, With other beings just like you? Then my main question to you is.

&gt;!ARE YOU ALONE???!&lt;",Futurology,my vision about technological and evolutional advancement of the universe and humanity hmm what does the good stories start with funny mind bending prologue everything that is written here is all my own thoughts my thoughts can be liable to change as i process these mysteries of our existence so be wary shall we see upon the first word of my vision technology and evolution of human species as our species started we were fish while crawling to the land of earth we had to evolve into species which could live on land after many cycles of evolution our species had adapted to the lifestyle of a land species we started on four legs time and time our species tried to get better on bipolar style that allowed for our first real technological evolution we were able to use our hands as tools that allowed our humanitys mind to create different kind of small technological steps creating fire was huge step as it taught to them about physics and chemistry of the universe humanity then tried to learn how to produce that mythical thing that they saw what a wondrous sight it must have been for the species at the time of their evolution species now sparked with this revolutionary energy which started their brain mind humanity to thirst for that energy we want that energy give it all to me screamed their humanity or what ever it is that we could call ourselves evolving thorough the decades after decades stars like the sun were most likely the first energy source we found but fire on earth is the step we were talking about the step to get sustainable energy as we adapted and adapted more into the technological advancement of our brain we were able to obtain the energy more easily and in higher quantity than ever before now further in the timeline we were able to harness the energy so well that our brain started to learn about things other than its sole purpose of harnessing the energy using the energy source to create different kind of tools and equipment to ease harnessing the energy so much power said the being its brain got enormously overloaded by energy which allowed for its true entity to appear entity now able to share energy for many branches which then branch into more branches a jungle of energy branches is what we could call that entity energy was now evolving in many new ways its hard to imagine how many energy branches there were evolving inside this entity multiplying on tremendous speed yearning for more more and more of the so called energy this is only thing we can do to get to our real reason for being our real reason for being is still way beyond the humanitys technology to speak the truth it might be way sooner than we ever expected what have we always wanted energy that is the sole purpose of our being stars that is what we call those energy sources the being called humanity yearns to get ever closer to those energy sources thats why about now humanity is trying to ascend closer to those realms of new enormous era of energy space is a big mystery for humanity its a place humanity has to traverse in attempt to harness the mysteries of the realm first step toward that dream was watching clouds float and feeling the embrace of the sky where you soar through the clouds covid how covid relates to all of this you may wonder why would it have any special meaning for our humanity we must firstly grasp the idea of earth and the universe so the virus is really nasty pest it spreads through the whole humanity infecting every single being in such a short time humanity cant fight back against it so what can we do as humanity to fight against this world destroying pest thats where our beings most valuable thing is core it becomes our most valuable thing to protect our supply of energy against this pest so what are the things humanity is struggling with what is our being imagining about what we should do in this case protect the core our core is the apex of our being we need to do everything we can to save this energy we will protect it by sacrificing the weakest part of our unity the cull the cull is starting to happen no matter what humanity does we cant stop it from spreading we need to minimize the loss of humanity from the weakest parts which our being doesnt need anymore all input tools we have will be lost as we struggle against the pest its trying to steal our energy we have gathered from time to time again as humanity is struggling communicating with the other things that have been able to communicate back this has been working so far we had some outbreaks before but this outbreak theres no way hundreds of millions of lives will be lost so what are our weakest parts as an symbiotic energy sphere which has evolved its threads to extraordinary lenghts when we evolve there is always the risk for an opposing force or thing or whatever we imagine it to be to appear as we try to communicate with all the things with our input systems covid is just that it communicates with us but it doesnt want to coexist it wants to eat us but we are stronger than it well most of us are senior citizens have really rough time the mortality rate is highest age that age group is humanitys one of if not biggest weakness in technological advancement their bodies are weak their energy source is starting to dim out outer shell is crumbling away still able to operate even if missing parts of outer shell but too weak to fight against stronger core that wants to conquer your energy within your core pest wants to expand its territory and oh boy that is what it is doing it will affect every single core in our being but gladly our being is stronger than the virus by removing its weakest parts like the senior citizens it can preserve way more energy to technologically advance all this to make our being stronger and it destroying the virus in the end we will see unimaginable number of casualties but we the strong part of humanity have to do our utmost best to survive this cataclysm we need to preserve ourselves for the future civilization to secure surviving while advancing technology as fast as we can only technology can extinguish the cataclysm and evolve us to beings beyond our imagination under work by huge amounts the earth has gravity in its athmosphere athmosphere then pulls everything that happens to be inside its radius towards the center humanity has been fighting this gravity for as long as they have existed now that humanity has come to this point of time where we have no need to be so tall to do things succesfully our kind has taken technology to the point of making us become curled up as an example i have different cases where we can apply this rule first of all we have communication worldwide this rule applies as humanity no longer needs to move the enormous amount of distances like before we can do everything via communication i mean you can pretty much get everything you could imagine if you had enough money without moving at all whilst previously humanity had to move hundreds of kilometers to get simple tasks done might be way more than that in reality we dont need to be so tall because everything is becoming smaller and smaller we are adapting to becoming smaller ourselves because being bigger would actually be weakness when adapting humanity to technology as one being as our generation is starting to curl up by different technological innovations firstly as we started to learn the means of traveling saving more of our brains energy we didnt need our legs that much anymore nowadays you can easily live your life without your legs thats a part of missing energy from our center or being or whatever we are we can function more effectively by removing part of our clumsy outer shell what is the purpose of our outer shell called body to maximize the potential of harnessing energy we get to our being now that our legs are starting to slow our evolution down our being is starting to remove its outer shell part by part legs seems to be one of the first signs of our outer shell fading away piece by piece hands are our input system for the being hands are clumsy at doing what they are doing with hands we can create things that we can imagine with our being something mythical can be created but the input is limiting our potential at creating things we can imagine if we could maximize the outputs value to better understand our outer shells input commands every single thing in our being is an input tool everything we do with our input systems feeds our being with extraordinary amounts of information which our being then tries to process for the input systems to materialize the things we imagine yes even those imaginations of mythical evolution of the universe all this in order to maximize the potential of harvesting energy for our core now humanity no longer needs their input tools to use its most potential to materialize things our being can imagine so how would our technological advancements come into the story well that is one big chapter to talk about first we could go as far as communication becoming a thing humanity was able to learn how to interact with other things in the universe other things that wanted that same energy as we were able to interact with this other being we could input tremendous amount of information by sharing with the other being compared to the other input systems we had evolved this was truly revolutionizing step this is just a draft of my thought at the moment more will appear as im able to materialize my thoughts there is way too much information for my brain to output that my input system is too slow to process into information that others can understand this might be work of my deppression added

"I’m building reLive, the sustainable death care solution that turns your body into a tree when you die and puts that tree in a memorial forest. Help me make this a movement.",23,"Hey folks, I want you to imagine something for a sec: what if instead of mourning our loved ones in graveyards dedicated to death, we celebrated them in forests dedicated to life?
I'm trying to make this vision a reality by building reLive, the sustainable death care solution that turns your body into a memorial tree when you die (by mixing CO2-neutrally cremated ashes with seeds and soil), and lays that tree to rest into a 'memorial forest' space – the graveyard of the 21st century.
I have a lot of visions for what this forest space would be like – it would be a beautiful, tranquil place you want to stay awhile. It would be a place for reflecting on the past and reconnecting with the present and with nature. There would be regular events to keep the space alive.
I am even imagining planting QR codes at the base of each memorial tree – when you scan them, these codes would pull up a live forum where friends and relatives of that person can post memories and photos, giving you an insight into who they were. It's the best way for someone coming to the end of their life to complete the circle of life and leave a sustainable legacy, and its a new way for all of us who remain to stay connected to those we have lost.
If you think this is a great concept, please join the movement! All you have to do is sign this petition:  
The more signatures I have, the more I can demonstrate people are interested in this, and the more likely I am to find an investor who will help me bring this concept to life.

I am not so sure.

In theory telecommuting allows employers to do away with the enormous costs of office space, which, in the more desirable places, can cost tens of thousands of dollars per worker. It means workers are never late due to traffic and they can work even if they have a cold. It also eliminates geographic barriers to recruiting.

Restarting the economy while social distancing,14,"A large part of the economy could be restarted while social distancing is still necessary.  There will be many challenges and problems to be overcome but we are good at solving problems and making things work. Benefits will result when we learn how to do this.  Less driving to workplaces or schools will help slow down climate change. There will be less transportation expense, less traffic, less office buildings and schools will need to be constructed and maintained. Diseases such as the current pandemic but also the yearly cycle of flu and colds could be reduced while the economy still functions.

Most education could be done remotely. Teachers would still be needed to direct studies, do remote lessons, grade practices, give evaluation tests and certify educational achievement.  There are problems that need to be overcome such as socialization, distribution of materials, care of young people if their parents need to work away from home and lunches during the day.  Problems could be overcome such as bullying, driving and busing students and teachers, mass shootings and disruptive students. What are other problems and benefits that would happen with remote education?

Most office work involves people sitting at a desk and working on a computer and phone.  This could be done at home with an internet connection.

36 [M4F] #Toronto - The Apocalypse really puts a sense of urgency in to intimacy,2,"The feeling of urgency when you meet someone who feels like your future is rare, and you need to keep yourself open to it for when it comes around.  When it doesn't work out, it actually can feel like someone has died, or like the Apocalypse.  But when a real Apocalypse is happening outside, small talk falls away and there is even more of a chance for these intense connections.

The virus is going to change our society, hopefully we can make some good changes, but humans are stupid and petty so I'm worried.

I'm a extrovert who thrives on human contact, so social distancing is one of the hardest things for me to have to do.  In a way, I would prefer this were a hurricane so I could at least get my big group of friends together to do something about it.  It's going to be hard to sit inside and feel like I'm doing nothing while front-line healthcare workers are getting sick.

Seriously, what I want is someone equally paranoid about transmitting the virus to their family who I click with well enough with that we will put ourselves in some mild risk to get that needed human touch, but who is otherwise being careful.  We need to hold on to our humanity through this.

More People = More Pandemics???,5,"I've been thinking about this for a while now, even before the outbreak of Covid-19. I've already posted this question, in different forms, to a couple other subreddits, but I haven't received a satisfying answer yet.

Basically, I'm thinking along these lines:

1. Pathogens use hosts as safe harbors for reproduction.
2. An increase in the number of hosts represents an increase in reproductive opportunities for a pathogen.
3. The more a pathogen reproduces itself, the more mutations accumulate in its genetic code.
4. The more mutations that occur, the more likely it is for a new strain of a disease to emerge. Such a new strain may be more virulent, and/or more resistant to treatment, and/or able to bypass the defenses of a previous vaccine.
5. Such new strains can manifest epidemics and pandemics.
6. As the human population grows, the number of possible human-hosts for an infection also increases.
7. Therefore, an increase in the human population, **in and of itself**, will result in an increased frequency of epidemics and pandemics. (See statements 1-6.)

**TL;DR** more people = more hosts = more opportunities for mutation &amp; transmission = more frequent plagues!

Also, it doesn't help that an increase in human population can lead to an increase in human interactions with animals, making cross-species transmission more likely.

Eventually, if no other limit to population growth presents itself, could we get to the point where pandemics occur every year? Or where **multiple** pandemic infections occur every year? 

Would this, if nothing else, put a cap on the potential human population of Earth? 

If we colonize space, could this effect limit the total human population in the Solar System?

If I'm wrong, please tell me why.

Thanks for reading!",Futurology,more people more pandemics ive been thinking about this for a while now even before the outbreak of covid ive already posted this question in different forms to a couple other subreddits but i havent received a satisfying answer yet basically im thinking along these lines pathogens use hosts as safe harbors for reproduction an increase in the number of hosts represents an increase in reproductive opportunities for a pathogen the more a pathogen reproduces itself the more mutations accumulate in its genetic code the more mutations that occur the more likely it is for a new strain of a disease to emerge such a new strain may be more virulent and or more resistant to treatment and or able to bypass the defenses of a previous vaccine such new strains can manifest epidemics and pandemics as the human population grows the number of possible human hosts for an infection also increases therefore an increase in the human population in and of itself will result in an increased frequency of epidemics and pandemics see statements  tl dr more people more hosts more opportunities for mutation amp transmission more frequent plagues also it doesnt help that an increase in human population can lead to an increase in human interactions with animals making cross species transmission more likely eventually if no other limit to population growth presents itself could we get to the point where pandemics occur every year or where multiple pandemic infections occur every year would this if nothing else put a cap on the potential human population of earth if we colonize space could this effect limit the total human population in the solar system if im wrong please tell me why thanks for reading

An interesting dilemma for you all to discuss.,4,"So in theory if we as a society decided to we could allow the government or say a corporation to track our location, and help us avoid collisions with other possibly asymptomatic carriers. I think we as a society should assume at this point that everyone is a potential asymptomatic carrier. Ideally we would all be isolated in separate rooms, but that's clearly not feasable. However we could create a sort of virtual room around a person. An airspace if you would.

Now the downside is absolutely obvious. The downside is a huge privacy violation, but you could make it so that no actual human would see the data. You could for example have the data processed and encrypted at your end. Then sent on to the nearest server where the all of the routing information is optimized to avoid infection. This clearly would have risks, but I personally assume they have my location already.

"As power utilization has shifted from commercial to residential settings due to COVID19 quarantine regulation, are we on the path to a more devastating fire season in the coming months (especially paired with the effects of climate change)?",15,"I've been evacuated for utility company caused fires twice in the last three years. Now, when it gets too hot, our utility company simply turns off all power in the community as a precaution. It sometimes stays off for up to a week.

When consumers are billed by the utility company that distributes power, one of the associated fees is related to the transfer of power to its destination (our homes). This $$$ amount increases during hotter months because energy is more easily lost during its transfer... e.g. we pay for 160% of the power because 60% is lost during transfer.

As global temperature increases due to climate change, paired with the utilization spikes on smaller, ""less prepared"" power grids, how much does fire danger increase during the hotter summer months?

[HELP] Should I major in ChemE or ECE?,4," Hi guys,

So I am a freshman in engineering that is undecided. I am really interested in working on renewable energy in the future. I was intending to do ChemE because I have always enjoyed chemistry classes. I am really interested in solar energy and discovering a new energy source just as algae-based solutions. These two majors have caught my attention. My concern is that if I do ECE I will just end up in a coding job, and if I do Chem. I will end up in the oil/gas industries. I have also seen that ChemE's end up going to research, but I am really interested in working with a team in the industry sector after college. I just want a broad major that will allow me to explore my passion for renewable energy systems.

Any advice on how I should decide my major would be greatly appreciated!!",Futurology, help should i major in cheme or ece hi guys so i am a freshman in engineering that is undecided i am really interested in working on renewable energy in the future i was intending to do cheme because i have always enjoyed chemistry classes i am really interested in solar energy and discovering a new energy source just as algae based solutions these two majors have caught my attention my concern is that if i do ece i will just end up in a coding job and if i do chem i will end up in the oil gas industries i have also seen that chemes end up going to research but i am really interested in working with a team in the industry sector after college i just want a broad major that will allow me to explore my passion for renewable energy systems any advice on how i should decide my major would be greatly appreciated

"If we invest more in healthcare in the future, we won't have to fear for our lives, and see the economy ruined",17,"This coronavirus crisis could have easily been averted if more was invested in healthcare. Private companies and employers are so suspicious and resistance against investing in healthcare for individuals, or in hospitals, and governments don't really want to contribute more money to revamping the hospital system in any country.... 


So we are left with hospitals that don't have enough room for people, very few medical researchers to work on cures for viral outbreaks, and the worst thing of all, a floundering economy because everyone is afraid to go outside and is practicing social just a thing. Which isn't a cost-effective way to combat a virus. The most effective way it would be medical research to create vaccines. Are we really going to just shut down society every single time there's a virus? That's going to cost trillions upon trillions of dollars in commerce and ruin the economy. Where we could just invest that money instead in healthcare and medical research, and prevent the issue entirely in the future


The true cause of the viral outbreak was ineffective handling of the virus, first off. As soon as it was known, flights should have been shut down from the region in which the outbreak occurred. No matter how inconvenient it was. Then, scientists and medical researchers should have been flown into that region to try and work on a cure for it. the secondary cause of course was the fact that medical research is so weak across the world because people don't want to invest in it.

How Viruses Mimic Human Behaviour,4,"A virus, as we all know, consumes its host. It makes safe harbor inside the host and begins to multiply and multiply at the host’s expense. Gradually, the host falls ill and weakens. Though the host has its own natural defenses against the virus, some viruses are strong enough to override such defenses. So, lacking medical intervention, the host dies, taking the virus with it. But the virus never intended to kill the host — that would be suicidal for the virus. Indeed, every dead host is a failing on the virus’ part. But the virus can’t help but consume its host. It is unable to reach an equilibrium with the host and doesn’t know how to coexist. In such circumstances, the only way for the virus to survive is by spreading to other hosts, thereby maximizing its chances for survival. 

There is another species on this planet that mimics the exact pattern of a virus: Human beings. See, human beings aren’t actually mammals. All mammals develop a natural equilibrium with their surrounding environment, but human beings do not. We feast upon the Earth, taking more than we should, not knowing when to stop — indeed, not knowing *how* to stop. Consumption is our way of life. We used to survive by spreading to other areas but now, with globalization and free trade, we need not move. We’ve woven a web around our planets resources and gradually consume our host. Already, some of us are all too aware that the only way for our species to survive is by spreading to another planet, by finding new hosts. 

The Spanish Flu in 1918, one day, just disappeared. It stopped infecting new hosts. Was there any medical intervention that allowed human beings to guard against the virus? No. Did the virus simply die? Likely not. The virus must have radically altered its behaviour, mutated in some way, and found a way to coexist with the host. We stopped recognizing the virus because we were still looking for the symptoms it used to exhibit, but the virus had already become something completely different from what it was before. 

So, if there’s a lesson in all of this, it’s that humanity should aspire to be more like the Spanish Flu. Learn to coexist with the host. Find a way to live harmoniously with the surrounding environment. ",Futurology,how viruses mimic human behaviour a virus as we all know consumes its host it makes safe harbor inside the host and begins to multiply and multiply at the hosts expense gradually the host falls ill and weakens though the host has its own natural defenses against the virus some viruses are strong enough to override such defenses so lacking medical intervention the host dies taking the virus with it but the virus never intended to kill the host that would be suicidal for the virus indeed every dead host is a failing on the virus part but the virus cant help but consume its host it is unable to reach an equilibrium with the host and doesnt know how to coexist in such circumstances the only way for the virus to survive is by spreading to other hosts thereby maximizing its chances for survival there is another species on this planet that mimics the exact pattern of a virus human beings see human beings arent actually mammals all mammals develop a natural equilibrium with their surrounding environment but human beings do not we feast upon the earth taking more than we should not knowing when to stop indeed not knowing how to stop consumption is our way of life we used to survive by spreading to other areas but now with globalization and free trade we need not move weve woven a web around our planets resources and gradually consume our host already some of us are all too aware that the only way for our species to survive is by spreading to another planet by finding new hosts the spanish flu in  one day just disappeared it stopped infecting new hosts was there any medical intervention that allowed human beings to guard against the virus no did the virus simply die likely not the virus must have radically altered its behaviour mutated in some way and found a way to coexist with the host we stopped recognizing the virus because we were still looking for the symptoms it used to exhibit but the virus had already become something completely different from what it was before so if theres a lesson in all of this its that humanity should aspire to be more like the spanish flu learn to coexist with the host find a way to live harmoniously with the surrounding environment

The Post-Agriculture Era,1,"Farming has been the cornerstone of human life for 10,000 years. For most of that period, the vast majority of human labor went into the production of food. But just as hunting and gathering became obsolete, so too will agriculture. 

The first thing to go will be the raising of livestock. We are just a [few years away](  from being able to buy lab grown meat and dairy at any Kroger's. Most of the world's farmland is dedicated one way or another to the raising of livestock, so that will get us most of the way to a post-agriculture period. The next step will be, by way of low cost solar power, the production of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins from coal, petroleum, or maybe even atmospheric carbon dioxide. With these, we can make all manner of processed food without any farming involved. And finally, there will be lab grown fruits and vegetables. 

The implications of this cannot be overstated. It will transform the lives of billions of people and bring modernity and urbanization to the undeveloped parts of the world. It will have enormous environmental benefits as farmland is returned to nature, rivers are no longer polluted with fertilizer runoff, and fisheries are no longer depleted. And most importantly, with food production being indifferent to drought, frost, and pests, our resilience to nature will greatly increase.",Futurology,the post agriculture era farming has been the cornerstone of human life for  years for most of that period the vast majority of human labor went into the production of food but just as hunting and gathering became obsolete so too will agriculture the first thing to go will be the raising of livestock we are just a few years away from being able to buy lab grown meat and dairy at any krogers most of the worlds farmland is dedicated one way or another to the raising of livestock so that will get us most of the way to a post agriculture period the next step will be by way of low cost solar power the production of carbohydrates proteins fats and vitamins from coal petroleum or maybe even atmospheric carbon dioxide with these we can make all manner of processed food without any farming involved and finally there will be lab grown fruits and vegetables the implications of this cannot be overstated it will transform the lives of billions of people and bring modernity and urbanization to the undeveloped parts of the world it will have enormous environmental benefits as farmland is returned to nature rivers are no longer polluted with fertilizer runoff and fisheries are no longer depleted and most importantly with food production being indifferent to drought frost and pests our resilience to nature will greatly increase

Post-Corona World,17," Hello world,

I wanted to share my thoughts on how I see the world post Coronavirus. Since the virus is incredibly contagious and has a high mortality rate, it will affect every community in the world causing massive healthcare problems. This will result in lockdowns and isolation for months (maybe longer) changing our lifestyles, habits and values. Here are the main changes to come: 

* No travel 
* no restaurants 
* no bars 
* no clubs 
* no large public gatherings (concerts, conferences, festivals, church services, sports events) 
* No public transport 
* No large office environments
* People watching a lot more youtube and Netflix 
* Social media becoming primary method of communication
* People working from home 
* Online education replacing traditional universities
* Government welfare for everyone in need 
* VR becoming more popular
* More people watching more often 
* Underground parties
* Back to farming (low scale)
* People forming distant communities (communes)
* A lot more hospitals and care centers   
   
And Most Importantly, **no more wars.** This is the first time in modern human history that we are faced with a common enemy thats not us! Governments will come together and use our collective military capacity to fight the virus and take care of people who are affected. This is a global problem and it will not be solved unless we come together and fight it as a single race. You wanted a silver lining, well, see above! 

Stay healthy and take care of each other,

i have discovered a way to gain immortality in 50-150 years and resurrect the dead in 150-600 years using technology,0," 

The Theory of Resurrection Using Technology in this post i will share with you a theory that will give humanity immortality within 50-150 years and resurrect the dead within 150-600 years 

“Those Who Dare Not Dream In The End Are Left With Nothing” - (a Quote by me Shir Itzhak Huber)

this theory will only happen if humanity manages to invent the technologies needed to make this theory a reality

Theory of immortality through Resurrection:

this theory is based on a phenomena where people see outside their body during surgery which i believe is their souls leaving and re entering their body.  
and how to use poison to make the soul of a dead person enter an artificial body effectively resurrecting him.  
this theory assumes souls are very small particles that remain where a person died until resurrected and link with the afterlife when they run out of life force before being resurrected.  
 

1. poisons: in order to resurrect the dead we need to obtain 2 poisons. the first Poison is a poison that I call soul removal poison.  
The soul of any person who is effected by this poison will leave the person’s body.  
The second poison we need is a poison I call soul absorption poison any soulless body that is effected by this person will absorb a nearby dead persons soul effectively reviving him.

2a. how to create the poisons: when a person goes through surgery sometimes he can see himself outside his body during the surgery.  
what I believe is happening is that his soul (a very small particle) left his body during the surgery and he can remember what his soul saw when it was outside his body when his soul is returned to his body.  
In order to create the soul removal poison we need to scan some patients brain during their surgeries and ask them if they had an out of body experience.  
Then we need to find the part of the brain that is normally working but stopped working during all of the surgeries where an out of body experience occurred.  
Then we need to create a poison that disables that part of the brain.  
To create the soul absorption poison we merely need to restore function to the part of the brain the soul removal poison disables.

2b. what to do if the soul absorption poison doesn't work:  
if the soul absorption poison doesn't work we need to find when an out of body experience ends.  
in order to find when an out of body experience ends precisely:  
there should be a change in brain activity from when the body is without a soul to when it has one and if we can find parts of the brain that are inactive before this change and are active after we can try and do Resurrection trials with re activating each of them along with the part of the brain that is responsible for keeping our soul inside our body until we find the part that is responsible for soul absorption   

2c. If I am correct using the 2 poisons together will cause the brain of an artificial body to absorb a dead man’s soul instead of a babies soul (resurrect rather then create a grown baby).

2d. the resurrection experiment:  
in order to prove the dead can be resurrected we will need to perform the following experiment.  
we put a stem cell body in a hospital whenever an organ donor that agrees to the experiment is undergoing low survival surgery.  
a stem cell body will be put in the corner of the surgery room.  
if the person dies the first organ to be removed will be the brain and it will be burned at the room to insure the person died in.  
after the brain is burned the stem cell body will be injected with the soul absorption poison and something to disable the soul removal poison.  
then we wait a few hours and see if the stem cell body gains consciousness.   
if it does we monitor it for a year and see if he regains his (the dead person's) memories on his own.  
if after a year he doesn't regain his memories (or shows any sign of being an adult and not a baby) we inject him with memory restoring medicine (if there will be a cure for Alzheimer's inject him with that and any other similar cure ) treat him as if he has Alzheimer's  
if by the age of 3 (from being resurrected) he doesn't regain his memories try and send him to a special school for the stem cell resurrected . if he doesn't grow up like a normal kid by the age of 5-7 (can't talk for example) (from being resurrected) then there is a defect in the stem cell body that is preventing him from regaining his memories and we need to improve the stem cell bodies before trying again  

2e. the experiment of resurrection will need to be carried out on thousands of volunteers at once each time to insure accuracy and speed up the resurrection    

3.why use stem cell bodies: we need to ensure the body we resurrect the dead to will not have a soul of its own. not when its created and not after.  
stem cell body can be created with no souls.  
if we poison the stem cell body with a soul removing poison before we finish printing it won't get its own soul.    
then when we want to resurrect the dead we replace the soul removing poison with a    
soul absorbing poison causing the stem cell body to resurrect the nearest dead soul  
there may be more steps but that's the basics of it

4. how to create the stem cell body:  
we print an entire human body using stem cells to create everything from blood to organs to bones using a 3d printer

5. resurrect long dead: I believe if a person is dead for too long his soul won’t be capable of being absorbed into a stem cell body (can’t be resurrected) without restoring its energy.  
We will need to figure out how the human brain charges the soul with energy I have a few guesses.

5a. emotions: if this is the case if we can figure a way to transmit human emotions into the air (hook a stimulated heart to a portable machine maybe).

5b. brain energy: I have a theory that when the humans sleep their brain recharges their souls with life energy if we hook up a brain to a machine that can extract this energy into the air we can use it to recharge dead souls and resurrect the long dead into stem cell bodies.

6. the inventions necessary to make this theory a reality have not yet been invented and would likely be invented by someone other then me. this theory is like a blueprint the four theories in it are the parts necessary to  make it a reality 

the four parts are:   
1. stem cell body  
2. soul removal poison  
3. soul absorption poison  
4. find out what energy our soul runs on and how to distribute it into the air (into souls that where dead for more then a certain time)

(only the first 3 parts are necessary for immortality part number 4 is necessary for resurrection and i predict it will take the longest to get)

Some countries may require a regular reading of you for example. Or all citizens could be required to have a test done during an outbreak.

It could be that we have legislation in place that requires the infected person to self isolate, with that time out being paid for or not depending on the country.

It could be that we don't require vaccinations at a population level anymore, except for high R.0 diseases such as measles. Though that wouldn't be required if we have tests that are very low imposition and as such clamp down on disease will before they are transmissible.

There will be countries that meet the higher criteria but anyone wanting to enter transport systemd such as airports in less developed countries will have to go thru that screening prior to entry.

Rise of cooking robots!,2,"I recently came across this [article](  and [this](  on how people are working towards automating the art of cooking! 

In the light of COVID19 epidemic, many of us are stuck at our homes. Well, talking about managing my food routine, it has become a literal hell for me. I can't cook that well (more of too lazy to cook), skeptical about ordering food online (issues of hygiene while cooking and delivery), same thing with eating out at restaurants. 
In light of such events, preparing breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday is a pain in the ass.

Monetizing Wisdom: A Solution to the Economic Downturn,7,"Odds are good that either you or someone close to you are hurting financially. This could be due to the recent Coronavirus outbreak, or perhaps your job was a casualty of the Automation Revolution. However you got here, you're here. This article is for you.

Around the world, [77% of people live in some form of multidimensional poverty](  Many are the victims of climate change—recently homeless due to drought, wildfires, and political unrest. Many have simply been born into poor conditions. Many live in areas that were once prosperous, but have become depressed for a variety of reasons.

People living in poverty have an abundance of untapped wisdom. A young man named Yusuff in Sierra Leone barely earns [$5 per day](  but he has a wealth of knowledge on football. Fatima in Afghanistan works 3 jobs to earn enough to feed her son, but she has a passion for chemistry and hopes to someday put her knowledge to use and finish her masters.

All around the world, men and women are struggling to get by, yet they harbor untold riches—facts and figures, intuitions, feelings, passions, and experiences. They are writers and thinkers, passionate creators and geeks. They're sports fans, film buffs, musicians, technicians, and artists. But an immeasurable amount of their knowledge, wisdom, and intellectual skill goes unshared. Their path is one of suffering, trapped within the harsh realities of poverty.

## Introducing a Different Way of Thinking

Imagine a different kind of world with me. In this world, every human is an entrepreneur. In this world, every person has a phone with internet, and they use it to monetize their own knowledge on everything from news and sports to theoretical physics and biology. Everything anyone knows is shared with the wider world, and each individual is paid for their contribution.

What might such a network allow us to accomplish? Researchers merge their minds into hives of activity—breaking down the hardest problems in minutes. Scientists seeking cures get the very best information from the world's brightest minds. Students learn from those in the field. Information flows freely and anonymously with no regard to status or class. Car mechanics ask questions and CEOs provide the answers. Everyone and everything they know is valued by someone.

A network like this is the solution we've been looking for—the solution to automation replacing our jobs, and depressions destroying our business prospects. A human superintelligence network comprised of hiveminds. A Hivenet.

## It's 2027. This is Ian.

Ian is an Australian refugee from a wildfire that burned up his home. The surrounding towns have become depressed and Ian is having trouble finding a job while he looks for a new place to live. Luckily he still has his smartphone and can get online when he finds free internet hotspots.

At a coffee shop along the way, Ian encounters another refugee named Fiona. Fiona is using a phone app to earn an income while she travels. It provides enough income to improve her life. She gets a notification and offers to show Ian how it works.

She plays a short multiplayer game with a group of people who share her interest in ecology. The group puts their minds together and comes up with a good answer to a question about how the recent outbreak in wildfires might impact the local ecology. The game ends, and Fiona is rewarded.

She explains that she just got paid for the answer she helped with, and she would also earn residual income as the answer is bought and used by others in the future. By playing this game every day, she is creating numerous new streams of income. Ian decides to download the app and give it a try.

Within a day, he has answered three questions and is earning money. Within a week, he has answered all kinds of questions based on his interests and skills. He’s earned enough to start making a noticeable improvement to his quality of life, and he feels like this simple game is helping him make a difference in the world.  


The year isn’t 2027. It’s 2020, but this could be our future.

Is there any existing survival social network ?,0," 

Hi guys,

Sorry for my english it's not my mother tongue.

I was wondering if there is any application / social network whose purpose is to organize people's goods/production/abilities. Let's say John is living near James (their proximity is known because of the GPS device of the app). John has 100 kg of rice and also a garden where he grew potatoes. So, John has goods (rice), a production of potatoes and an ability (gardening). Now, in time of crisis (or pre-crisis), he meets James via the app. James has also some stock of goods, a production (chicken coop let's say) and he is a doctor in his daily life (so it's his ability).

The idea is to pre-organize small community. The geolocation is a big plus. If there is an inventory device in the app, we could see in a specific and close area a system of a common stock ( John trade with James his surplus without any exchange of money, just barter). Also everyone could count one the abilities and production of others. You don't have to grew vegetable if you don't have the ground or the ability.

Also, one big plus is to avoid any panic reaction like we can see in our days. If you know that one your neighbour (the geolocation is not too precise in order to avoid theft) has *x* stock of something, you can avoid the shortage fear.

Finally, even without any crisis, this app would be an alternative to the actual state and big compagny's control of our economic life.

I know that some communities are already living like that (or trying) but my question is about the existence of an app/network that would ease this task ? And if not, what do you thing about the utility of creating one ?",Futurology,is there any existing survival social network hi guys sorry for my english its not my mother tongue i was wondering if there is any application social network whose purpose is to organize peoples goods production abilities lets say john is living near james their proximity is known because of the gps device of the app john has kg of rice and also a garden where he grew potatoes so john has goods rice a production of potatoes and an ability gardening now in time of crisis or pre crisis he meets james via the app james has also some stock of goods a production chicken coop lets say and he is a doctor in his daily life so its his ability the idea is to pre organize small community the geolocation is a big plus if there is an inventory device in the app we could see in a specific and close area a system of a common stock john trade with james his surplus without any exchange of money just barter also everyone could count one the abilities and production of others you dont have to grew vegetable if you dont have the ground or the ability also one big plus is to avoid any panic reaction like we can see in our days if you know that one your neighbour the geolocation is not too precise in order to avoid theft has x stock of something you can avoid the shortage fear finally even without any crisis this app would be an alternative to the actual state and big compagnys control of our economic life i know that some communities are already living like that or trying but my question is about the existence of an app network that would ease this task and if not what do you thing about the utility of creating one

The NBA should finish the season in ESports,6," We are facing two dangers, the virus &amp; economic slowdown.

We should not run from one into the other. We should do everything we can to adapt and continue as much economic activity as possible.

One way for the NBA to lead the way is for players to finish the season using live streamed (ESPN also) NBA video games.

This will get peoples minds of the virus, show people we can adapt, and will spur some much needed economic activity.

As far as adapting all the sports should do the same but it goes way beyond that.

Education, Work, Entertainment, shopping, and especially home improvement can provide many opportunities to continue economic activity even under quarantine.

For example for people living in single family homes they can continue to spend money on home improvement projects like water harvesting, indoor farming, small scale solar, and more.

Restaurants should stay open and provide carry out and delivery as much as possible.

The government wants to pump money into the economy including into peoples hands but if there is no way for them to spend it then it is useless. We must find ways for people to be productive and economically active during this crisis period.

We made a mailing list for those interested in the future of ethical alternatives,20,"##TL:DR
Studies show that 90% of people prefer ethical brands when they shop. So why are these brands not taking over? Well, they simply can't get noticed when the rest of the world is spending $280B annually for your attention. My friends, colleagues, and I have started a mailing list at   for anyone who wants to learn about recent, realistic alternatives to the products they use. 

##My background
I've been working on a tech startup in market research for a few months and have gotten to know the advertising and consumer research process for massive brands intimately (P&amp;G, Unilever, RB, etc). During that journey, a few employees and friends started emailing each other when they found companies making ethical and environmental alternatives to these name brands. Personally, I was fascinated at the kinds of things we were finding. It’s about time we expand this community to you guys. We’re starting with a mailing list which you can join at  

##The kind of stuff we share
We prefer a practical over a hardline approach to improving our consumption. We like products that are realistic alternatives to the goods we already consume (they have to be just as awesome). We focus on the ethically and environmentally sustainable, prioritizing fair wages and human rights. For example, I love this company we found which makes shoes out of pineapple waste. They're this young bunch of Kenyan entrepreneurs and the shoes look great. Sort of like a pineapple textile Allbirds.

##Aren't there loads of blogs and sites that already do this?
Weekly mailing lists are a super digestible way to expose brands that make the world a better place. - A lot of sustainability advice is really impractical. Nobody is going to start going without or making their own shoes, but we can choose to buy from companies that align with our values. We try to help the majority of people who are only starting consuming ethically. - We have a much bigger vision - we want to build a community that supports sustainability in a way that’s accessible and practical, starting with a mailing list and going beyond!

##How do we pick what goes into the digest?
It's pretty ad-hoc right now, but we try to focus on great products, sustainability, and fairly obscure brands most people wouldn't have heard of themselves. We're also always looking for suggestions from communities like these, so PLEASE reach out if you're aware of any companies that must go in our digest.",Futurology,we made a mailing list for those interested in the future of ethical alternatives tl dr studies show that of people prefer ethical brands when they shop so why are these brands not taking over well they simply cant get noticed when the rest of the world is spending b annually for your attention my friends colleagues and i have started a mailing list at for anyone who wants to learn about recent realistic alternatives to the products they use my background ive been working on a tech startup in market research for a few months and have gotten to know the advertising and consumer research process for massive brands intimately p amp g unilever rb etc during that journey a few employees and friends started emailing each other when they found companies making ethical and environmental alternatives to these name brands personally i was fascinated at the kinds of things we were finding its about time we expand this community to you guys were starting with a mailing list which you can join at the kind of stuff we share we prefer a practical over a hardline approach to improving our consumption we like products that are realistic alternatives to the goods we already consume they have to be just as awesome we focus on the ethically and environmentally sustainable prioritizing fair wages and human rights for example i love this company we found which makes shoes out of pineapple waste theyre this young bunch of kenyan entrepreneurs and the shoes look great sort of like a pineapple textile allbirds arent there loads of blogs and sites that already do this weekly mailing lists are a super digestible way to expose brands that make the world a better place a lot of sustainability advice is really impractical nobody is going to start going without or making their own shoes but we can choose to buy from companies that align with our values we try to help the majority of people who are only starting consuming ethically we have a much bigger vision we want to build a community that supports sustainability in a way thats accessible and practical starting with a mailing list and going beyond how do we pick what goes into the digest its pretty ad hoc right now but we try to focus on great products sustainability and fairly obscure brands most people wouldnt have heard of themselves were also always looking for suggestions from communities like these so please reach out if youre aware of any companies that must go in our digest

"COVID-19 &amp; its implications for the survivability of future space travel, habitation, and colonization",9,"# TL,DR: social distancing is likely to be impossible even in advanced colonies and spacecraft far into the future. Anything with COVID-19's characteristics might rapidly wipe out crew, residents, etc.

So this one's probably *really* far into the future, but I thought about it yesterday.

Even if advance tech gives us fusion powered plasma rocket engines and the like, future spacecraft and colonies are likely to be largely confined spaces with very little facility for quarantine.

You may wonder how such a pathogen would get aboard in the first place. Well first of all, it might not be something we screen for, or it could have a long incubation time, as COVID-19 does. We could launch an infected astronaut who could spread the disease to the entire crew after they left orbit. It could also be in the supplies themselves. 

Consider a manned resupply ship on which that happens. The distant colony can't do without the resupplies, and crew dies *en route*. The ship can still land at its destination; it'll just be a hot zone. What does the colony decide? What if they decide to take the shipment and then one of the colonists gets sick? Do they even bother to treat that person or send them out an airlock for the good of everyone else?

Really tough questions. Thoughts?",Futurology,covid amp its implications for the survivability of future space travel habitation and colonization tl dr social distancing is likely to be impossible even in advanced colonies and spacecraft far into the future anything with covid s characteristics might rapidly wipe out crew residents etc so this ones probably really far into the future but i thought about it yesterday even if advance tech gives us fusion powered plasma rocket engines and the like future spacecraft and colonies are likely to be largely confined spaces with very little facility for quarantine you may wonder how such a pathogen would get aboard in the first place well first of all it might not be something we screen for or it could have a long incubation time as covid does we could launch an infected astronaut who could spread the disease to the entire crew after they left orbit it could also be in the supplies themselves consider a manned resupply ship on which that happens the distant colony cant do without the resupplies and crew dies en route the ship can still land at its destination itll just be a hot zone what does the colony decide what if they decide to take the shipment and then one of the colonists gets sick do they even bother to treat that person or send them out an airlock for the good of everyone else really tough questions thoughts

For information on current our citizen science projects, visit   Most projects require no prior knowledge, experience, or special tools beyond a computer or cell phone. And don't worry if you didn't study science in school; these projects aim to teach you everything you need to know.


We are here to answer your questions! Ask us about:

+ Why NASA needs your help
+ How you can conduct scientific analysis and discoveries
+ Which project might be right for you
+ What you can expect when you become part of NASA's citizen science team

Aerodynamics: why should max lift-to-drag airspeed be the same as min-drag airspeed?,7,"I need help from someone who knows aerodynamics well, in connection with aerodynamics study material that all student pilots are asked to learn, specifically how the lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio varies as a function of airspeed.

The basic idea is to give the pilot an intuition of the fact that lift grows quadratically with airspeed, and so (somewhat) does drag, but there's a component of drag (induced) that grows a lot if you fly slow. For this reason, total drag exhibits a U-shaped plot, and the airspeed corresponding to the butt of the U is a sweet spot that gives you best range. That's the airspeed you should fly at for best economy, and the airspeed to establish in case of engine loss, to achieve best glide distance. If you fly faster, you glide less, and if you also fly slower, you also glide less.

More specifically, Most ground schools, including official FAA sanctioned material, present the same or very similar airspeed-drag charts, all having airspeed in knots on the x axis, and arbitrary drag units on y. They all plot parasite, induced, form (sometimes) and total drag curves. (Total drag D is the sum of parasite, induced and form drag.) Here is an example: [ 

They consistently make the claim that **the airspeed maximizing L/D is also the one that minimizes total drag**.

Note: they don't say that the two airspeeds (the one maximizing L/D and the one minimizing D) are **close enough** that we can confound them. No, they say they are the same. 

I'm a weekend pilot with a background in engineering and a day job in a quantitative field, and this claim bothers me. I played around for five minutes with a graphic calculator and plugged in simple functions that look close enough to those in the abstract plots:

* DI = Induced drag = 1/(500v)
* DF = Form Drag = 5 + 1/100 (v-45)\^2
* DP = Parasite Drag = 1/200 v\^2
* L = Lift = 1/5 v\^2
* D = Total Drag = DI+DF+DP

Of course, empirical experiments confirm my intuition that there's no chance in hell that argmax(L(v)/D(v)) matches argmin(D(v)).

Am I right? Am I wrong?

Of course the FAA's goal is not to teach physics, it's rather to give pilot simplified, actionable intuition that is mostly physically correct and that inspires the right in-flight decision.

But I'd like to hear from an expert how things really are.",askscience,aerodynamics why should max lift to drag airspeed be the same as min drag airspeed i need help from someone who knows aerodynamics well in connection with aerodynamics study material that all student pilots are asked to learn specifically how the lift to drag l d ratio varies as a function of airspeed the basic idea is to give the pilot an intuition of the fact that lift grows quadratically with airspeed and so somewhat does drag but theres a component of drag induced that grows a lot if you fly slow for this reason total drag exhibits a u shaped plot and the airspeed corresponding to the butt of the u is a sweet spot that gives you best range thats the airspeed you should fly at for best economy and the airspeed to establish in case of engine loss to achieve best glide distance if you fly faster you glide less and if you also fly slower you also glide less more specifically most ground schools including official faa sanctioned material present the same or very similar airspeed drag charts all having airspeed in knots on the x axis and arbitrary drag units on y they all plot parasite induced form sometimes and total drag curves total drag d is the sum of parasite induced and form drag here is an example they consistently make the claim that the airspeed maximizing l d is also the one that minimizes total drag note they dont say that the two airspeeds the one maximizing l d and the one minimizing d are close enough that we can confound them no they say they are the same im a weekend pilot with a background in engineering and a day job in a quantitative field and this claim bothers me i played around for five minutes with a graphic calculator and plugged in simple functions that look close enough to those in the abstract plots di induced drag  v df form drag   v  dp parasite drag  v l lift  v d total drag di df dp of course empirical experiments confirm my intuition that theres no chance in hell that argmax l v d v matches argmin d v am i right am i wrong of course the faas goal is not to teach physics its rather to give pilot simplified actionable intuition that is mostly physically correct and that inspires the right in flight decision but id like to hear from an expert how things really are

"AskScience AMA Series: My name is Dr. Joseph Allen, and I am an Assistant Professor of exposure assessment science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Director of Harvard’s Healthy Buildings Program. Ask me anything about COVID-19 and the future of the built environment, AMA!",55,"I am an Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the founding director of the [Healthy Buildings Program](  I also have a new book, out last month: *[Healthy Buildings](  In March 2020, I became co-chair of the International Well Building Institute’s Coronavirus Task Force.

For several years in private industry before joining the faculty at Harvard, I led teams of scientists and engineers investigating, and resolving, hundreds of indoor environmental quality issues, from'sick buildings' to cancer clusters to all types of chemical/radiological/biological hazards. I learned two important facts: 1) too often we are responding to issues after there is a problem, and 2) we cannot solve these problems without a multidisciplinary approach. I have an interest in the dynamic interplay between the indoor environment and health and am continuing this line of research at Harvard, with a focus on optimizing indoor environments for health benefits. A natural extension of my research on buildings and the indoor environment is the consideration of the products we use in those environments, and how those influence our exposure and health.

I believe that we have to force a collision between these two disciplines: building science and health science. The indoor built environment (homes, offices, schools, hospitals, airplanes, laboratories) plays a critical role in our overall health, both due to the amount of time we spend indoors (~90%) and the ability of the buildings to positively and negatively influence our exposure. The goal is to improve the health of all people, in all buildings, everywhere, every day.

The pandemic spawned by the novel coronavirus has given us a heightened awareness of the role our buildings play in our health and wellbeing. I'm on the record back in [early February](  advocating for healthy buildings strategies, like air filtration and increased ventilation, to reduce the spread of the virus indoors. Since then, I've written several articles about what we can do to reduce our exposure to the virus, including in [grocery stores](  [public parks](  and [cars/ride shares]( 

I've also joined forces with my colleagues at Harvard's Center for Communicable Diseases to develop a detailed plan for saving lives and the economy:   I'll see you all at 1 PM ET (17 UT), AMA!",askscience,askscience ama series my name is dr joseph allen and i am an assistant professor of exposure assessment science at the harvard t h chan school of public health and director of harvards healthy buildings program ask me anything about covid and the future of the built environment ama i am an assistant professor of exposure assessment science at the harvard t h chan school of public health and the founding director of the healthy buildings program i also have a new book out last month healthy buildings in march  i became co chair of the international well building institutes coronavirus task force for several years in private industry before joining the faculty at harvard i led teams of scientists and engineers investigating and resolving hundreds of indoor environmental quality issues fromsick buildings to cancer clusters to all types of chemical radiological biological hazards i learned two important facts too often we are responding to issues after there is a problem and we cannot solve these problems without a multidisciplinary approach i have an interest in the dynamic interplay between the indoor environment and health and am continuing this line of research at harvard with a focus on optimizing indoor environments for health benefits a natural extension of my research on buildings and the indoor environment is the consideration of the products we use in those environments and how those influence our exposure and health i believe that we have to force a collision between these two disciplines building science and health science the indoor built environment homes offices schools hospitals airplanes laboratories plays a critical role in our overall health both due to the amount of time we spend indoors  and the ability of the buildings to positively and negatively influence our exposure the goal is to improve the health of all people in all buildings everywhere every day the pandemic spawned by the novel coronavirus has given us a heightened awareness of the role our buildings play in our health and wellbeing im on the record back in early february advocating for healthy buildings strategies like air filtration and increased ventilation to reduce the spread of the virus indoors since then ive written several articles about what we can do to reduce our exposure to the virus including in grocery stores public parks and cars ride shares ive also joined forces with my colleagues at harvards center for communicable diseases to develop a detailed plan for saving lives and the economy ill see you all at pm et ut ama

We are here to talk about St. Helens and volcanic eruptions. Ask us anything!",459,"In March 1980, new magma began to intrude beneath Mount St. Helens. Over the next 2 months, the north flank of the mountain began to bulge up to 450 feet (~150 m) outward. At 0832 am, Sunday May 18th, 15-20 seconds after a M5.1 earthquake, the north flank collapsed in the largest recorded landslide, allowing the pressurized magma to explode outward in a lateral blast and pyroclastic density current that levelled ~230 square miles of forest. Over the next ~9 hours, about 0.3 cubic miles of ash and pumice erupted explosively. That ash was distributed locally as highly destructive pyroclastic flows and hundreds of miles away as ash fall. The eruption had profound impacts on the science of volcanology, volcano monitoring, hazard communication, and hazard mitigation.
